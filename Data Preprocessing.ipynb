My resting HB was 100 and I had cluster headaches, sleep apnea and IBS. I finally filed for divorce at age 45 and promptly ended up in the hospital with pneumonia, pleurisy, and an abscess on one lung. The docs couldn't imagine where I got such a nasty bug. Three different antibiotics in my IV plus alternating injections of morphine and vicoden for the pain. I lost 25 pounds in one week and was down to about 125 lbs. (I'm 5'8\") I moved out - with my son shortly afterwards and the court awarded me custody. Fast forward. I'm 58 and that was the last time I had any lung disease.

So how do you get rats off an island, hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum, and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait. The rats come for the coconut, and..they fall into the drum, and after a month, you've trapped all the rats. But what did you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You justÂ leave it. And they begin to get hungry, then one by one...Â They start eating each other, until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what - do you kill them? No. You take them, and release them into the trees. Only now, they don't eat coconut anymore. Now they will only eat rat. You have changed their nature.

Kind of like how my four-year-old says he's not scared of anything, but then I try to take him into the basement without turning the lights on and he freaks out.  It might seem logical that fervently religious people are less fearful of death because they're so assured of the afterlife.  And it might seem logical that fervent atheists are less fearful of death because they've always thought of life as the only existence with death being final and inevitable.  But I think that's ridiculous.  Everyone fears death.  A much more likely explanation is that fervent theists and fervent atheists are just the people who are most likely to claim they don't fear death because they're just paying lip service to an ideology that they strongly identify with.

I was in denial when I first heard about it, and I kept on thinking, \"this is one of those cancers where the survival rate is high and there's always something you can do about it\". Within the first week, he had a blood test to check for cancer markers (which, as expected, was elevated) and  we talked to a surgeon about biopsy and removing part of the colon where the tumor was. The main concern was that there might be more tumors outside of the colon and they were only seeing a small part of it, but they found none. He had a repeat colonoscopy after 6 months and found no tumors, and his cancer marker test was normal. We didn't even talk to an oncologist because there was no need for chemotherapy.

      "As that correlation is considered, the mere consideration by the brain causes the memory to be recalled, and causes the user to experience or re-live the bad experience, and instead of enhancing the present with a useful correlation, the brain has caused the person to re-live or recall that bad experience, which then further strengthens that correlation for future recall..

      "In order to combat an \"over-correlating\" brain (in the cases where the correlations cause negativity), i believe one has to \"de-correlate\" the memories by attempting to cognitively \"destroy\" those memories (weakening the neurological pathway). When a negative correlation causes negative feelings in the present, the user must actively cause the brain to think about something \"happy\" or \"positive\" (a past memory that brings joy, or a memory that could enhance the present experience causing the correlation). This way, when the same correlation is drawn, the brain will show the \"happy thought\" rather than the \"unwanted thought\". We must control our brains. \r\n",

Your friends will constantly want to go out during the week, whether that's happy hours on Tues., for dinner on Thurs. or for a night out on the town on Fri./Sat.  Everything revolves around alcohol.  Then when you get to your late 20s you find yourself polishing off 2-3 beers every single day as soon as you get home from work, you might also even have a glass of wine with dinner everyday.  By the time you're in your 30s and 40s, you're now at a 6 pack or more every single day after work and you're killing a 30 pack all by yourself every single week.  I know tons of my friends who have followed that pattern, although they don't always stick to beer but also include a sifter of brandy, some whiskey neat, or other liquor when they get home from work.  One of them admitted to me that they have to have a pint glass full of vodka w/ some sort of juice or something every single day in order to fall asleep - and that's probably after several beers right after work when they're cooking dinner or watching some type of sporting event (baseball, basketball, hockey, football).  \r\n",

I dont know the exact mechanics, obviously, but from the small scale Ive seen this happen Im assuming the kids who had sweet options preferred the sweet options (who wouldnt) while the other one didnt even realize what he was eating was bitter in comparison to other foods. I think that makes sense? Then again it could just be the kid just naturally likes vegetables or maybe his parents are just better cooks, because they are.

Men no longer need intimacy since they can get all the stimulation they want from porn. This applies to a small minority of women as well who consume porn.  \n",

I've told my whole story in other places, but what happened was that because I was under the impression for my whole young life that abstinence was the best way to live, I ignored everything I saw pertaining to what healthy sexual relationships were supposed to be like. Practically as soon as I left home and went to college, though, I was easily manipulated by a dishonest person who ended up taking advantage of me continually to a point where I was straight up being abused. In school, I was taught that it was wrong for adults to make improper sexual advances toward children, but as soon as you're legal you're on your own, kiddo. Whatever happens to you is your own fault because you're a weak willed hoe. Even if girls don't end up getting pregnant, an abstinence-only education can be detrimental in unforeseen ways. \r\n",

      "My wife had mono as a child (pre-teens) bad enough to be hospitalized for quite a while. She developed ovarian cancer as a young teen, though it was misdiagnosed as cervical after 2 years of symptoms (very heavy bleeding, lots of pain, but she didn't realize it was abnormal until an event at school where she was incapacitated by the pain and her combination of tampon+pad that she thought was normal to use in combination wasn't enough to stop the bleeding). Long medical story but that all happened around 13 or 14 and she eventually was cancer free around 22 after a couple recurrences. During that time she has also been diagnosed with lupus (don't know if that diagnosis is still applicable or if the symptoms were eventually tied to another condition), rheumatoid arthritis, and I suspect she has inflammatory bowel disease. Her stomach can't handle meats besides fish, though she grew up on game meats so this intolerance happened post-mono. It's worth pointing out that autoimmune disease runs heavily in her family, though not RA specifically. We finally finished clearing out her medical debt this year (a lot of her surgeries were done as a teen and done pro bono by a wonderful doctor, but she still racked up an amazing amount of debt and refused to discharge it through bankruptcy).

I said: subject specific knowledge. You would not believe the look of utter disdain I got, as though I just took a shit right there.

Other studies that indicate things you can _actually_ do to improve learning outcomes are ignored. For example, putting a plant in your classroom improves on-task behavior by 5%.

For someone who wants to commit suicide *right now*, a gun is much more likely to be available *right now*.

The thing is, those take minutes or hours to work, and the person may well have a change of heart, might be discovered, or may not do it properly. Since all methods other than gun are less effective than gunshot, some considerably so, my bet is that the percentage of people who successfully commit suicide in urban areas is relatively low.\r\n",

Now that I am of legal age in my country I have started to utilize the medicinal marijuana programs and receive actual counselling from experienced Doctors. This is just my personal opinion from someone who suffers from anxiety and developed through puberty with an imbalance in natural Cannabinoid development. I have prescription Marijuana (same stuff that Snoop Dogg gets) with both CBD and THC specific strains. \"Over using\" THC can cause the body to have minor \"overdoses\" on THC, which based on my experience these overdoses can cause mild paranoia which actually comes across as extreme attention to detail when it comes to your physical body eg.

      "\r\n",
      "Drexel's main drawing point is it's co-op program that matches students with a vast selection of companies in order to give the student an opportunity to gain some relevant work experience before graduating. While this is not mandatory, the typical degree programs give a student the opportunity to complete 3 co-ops (6 months each) equating to roughly 18 months of job experience. This experience is separate from schooling and means that a typical graduation takes 5 years. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I also investigated Drexel's cost of tuition coupled with the average financial aid received. Drexel prides itself on offering 90+% of its students with scholarships for its exorbitant tuition of $55,000/year. The Dean's Scholarahip is a $26,000 scholarship that help many students afford attending, however this scholarship requires a 3.0 average. Drexel also runs on the quarter system, so terms are usually 10 weeks, and many classes are essentially accelerated in order to make up for the time you will be spending on co-op. If you drop below a 3.0, which 25% of the incoming freshman class does, you are put on probation and one more quarter below a 3.0 results in you losing this aid entirely. Without the deans scholarship students are forced to make the difficult decision to continue their education which requires hefty loans, or transfer, which will result in the loss of many credits as the quarter system is largely unaccepted across the country. The average debt for a student graduating from Drexel is over $100,000 correlating to over 1000$+ per month payments to repay student loans. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Don't let Drexel's co-op program and Dean's scholarship fool you into believing the value is there. If you want a comparable experience that is FREE, northwestern offers a very similar experience of no cost to students.

Is the mother immune system reacting negatively because of the extra X chromosome that females gain? Is it acting more positively because of an Y chromosome within males? If that's the case then shouldn't mothers also react differently when impregnated with fetuses that carry XXY, XXZ, and/or any other mutation that can at times distort the gender, anatomy of a baby?  \n",

So SWAT's sent out on routine shit like serving warrants not be cause someone actually thinks they're needed to keep officers safe or to reduce crime, they're being sent out both for live training and so when the budgeting committees look at their budget, they can say 'look at what our money is doing even when we don't need them. \n",

The vast majority of these bacterial cells are in the intestinal tract, and they serve many purposes, including digesting foods, manufacturing certain vitamins (for example, vitamin K), and regulating our immune system. Researchers are actively studying whether changes in intestinal bacteria can increase the risk of chronic illnesses, such as obesity or inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n",
      "Interest is also developing in the so-called brain-gut axis. It has been theorized that changes in intestinal bacteria may play a role in neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety or depression. The intestine has its own separate nervous system, and generates many of the same neurotransmitters (including acetylcholine and serotonin) that the brain generates. These neurotransmitters are very important in promoting gut motility, and too much or too little of them may result in constipation or diarrhea. Similarly, we believe that the brain and the gut can talk to each other. Therefore, it is possible that anxiety and depression may trigger abdominal pain or other GI symptoms. It is also possible that gastrointestinal conditions such as chronic abdominal pain or constipation might also result in anxiety or depression.\" \n",

We'd bike to the park, to the nearby arcade, to the community pool, to the movie theater, to our school to play basketball, to the store - I feel like there was a pretty early \"you're old enough to figure it out\" kind of mentality then.  It's really weird, because I always assumed that a lot of these helicopter parents had the same kind of childhood that I did, but maybe they didn't.  My friend has a kid now and I think he and his wife are actually pretty good about giving their little girl the independence a kid needs while still offering support.

      "Anecdotally - with a somewhat educated knowledge of weather.  Im a pilot, so weather is obviously a big part of the job and something we look at constantly. 25 years ago when I first got into aviation wed see these large sweeping frontal systems pushing weather across the US from west to east, then often sliding northeast up the eastern seaboard - pretty much what weve expected for weather since whenever. Pretty general, I know... but you get used to patterns. Over the last decade or so Ive seen far fewer wide systems.  Sure, theres little fits and starts of cold fronts moving down out of Canada, but they dont reach as deep into the south as they used to and they dont move as quickly as they used to. The speed is decreased along with the temperature differential that used to generate those big air mass thunderstorms in a big line. Yeah, we still get some big ones, but after dodging them across the country for the last few years Ive noticed things are a lot less organized. This year especially - but I blame that on the particulate matter being dumped in the atmosphere by the fires all over the western 1/3 of North America messing things up. Also, Ive noted that things are just stifling, those slow moving systems also mean that the heat and humidity just sit and smother an area. Where Im sitting right now is 80° and 85% humidity at 9 in the morning. Yuk.  \n",
