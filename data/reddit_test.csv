&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;River piracy-the diversion of the headwaters of one stream into another one-can dramatically change the routing of water and sediment, with a profound effect on landscape evolution. Stream piracy has been investigated in glacial environments, but so far it has mainly been studied over Quaternary or longer timescales. Here we document how retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier-one of Canada's largest glaciers-abruptly and radically altered the regional drainage pattern in spring 2016. We use a combination of hydrological measurements and drone-generated digital elevation models to show that in late May 2016, meltwater from the glacier was re-routed from discharge in a northward direction into the Bering Sea, to southward into the Pacific Ocean. Based on satellite image analysis and a signal-to-noise ratio as a metric of glacier retreat, we conclude that this instance of river piracy was due to post-industrial climate change. Rapid regional drainage reorganizations of this type can have profound downstream impacts on ecosystems, sediment and carbon budgets, and downstream communities that rely on a stable and sustained discharge. We suggest that the planforms of Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers will adjust in response to altered flows, and the future Kaskawulsh watershed will extend into the now-abandoned headwaters of Slims River and eventually capture the Kluane Lake drainage.",0

Thanks guys! I'll attempt to summarize what I gleaned:
Using a person's own cells is a somewhat known technology with good results, but there are 2 main reasons that scientists in general want to move to using donor cells:

1. They can create a bank of donor cells. These will be available for transplant much quicker than extracting and modifying one's own cells. It could also potentially be cheaper with mass centralised production.

2. The person's cells may be mutated naturally during growth or they may have a genetic defect since birth. It is much easier to avoid this by using generalised donor cells than test every single person's cells

I had a perception professor who was fond of starting each class with ""what you are seeing right now may or may not be real"" in an ominous tone, and the concrete science behind that absolutely geeks me out. 

I've known I never wanted to become a doctor, despite an interest in biology/physiology. The intense schooling didn't appeal to me, in addition the the idea I've had that I want to make an impact on the medical community in a bigger way than direct patient to doctor interaction.

However, I've found opportunities to be sparse. I'm in healthcare consulting now and gearing towards public health, but I would love to actually use my neuroscience degree and continue to study the brain. Do you have any recommendations?

I'm not opposed to more schooling, just didn't want to be a physician. Are there clubs, extracurriculars, societies out there that you'd recommend beyond the slim job opportunities? I'm based in be DC area, if that helps. 

Thank you!!!!",0

In a 10-day study of 81 professional and managerial employees, we find that witnessed morning rudeness leads to greater perceptions of workplace rudeness throughout the workday and that those perceptions, in turn, predict lower task performance and goal progress and greater interaction avoidance and psychological withdrawal. We also find that the contaminating effect of morning rudeness depends on core self-evaluations (CSE)-employees high (vs. low) in CSE are affected less by exposure to morning rudeness.

"13131",13320,"Abstract

Vaccine refusal can lead to renewed outbreaks of previously eliminated diseases and even delay global eradication. Vaccinating decisions exemplify a complex, coupled system where vaccinating behavior and disease dynamics influence one another. Such systems often exhibit critical phenomena-special dynamics close to a tipping point leading to a new dynamical regime. For instance, critical slowing down (declining rate of recovery from small perturbations) may emerge as a tipping point is approached. Here, we collected and geocoded tweets about measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and classified their sentiment using machine-learning algorithms. We also extracted data on measles-related Google searches. We find critical slowing down in the data at the level of California and the United States in the years before and after the 2014-2015 Disneyland, California measles outbreak. Critical slowing down starts growing appreciably several years before the Disneyland outbreak as vaccine uptake declines and the population approaches the tipping point. However, due to the adaptive nature of coupled behavior-disease systems, the population responds to the outbreak by moving away from the tipping point, causing ""critical speeding up"" whereby resilience to perturbations increases. A mathematical model of measles transmission and vaccine sentiment predicts the same qualitative patterns in the neighborhood of a tipping point to greatly reduced vaccine uptake and large epidemics. These results support the hypothesis that population vaccinating behavior near the disease elimination threshold is a critical phenomenon. Developing new analytical tools to detect these patterns in digital social data might help us identify populations at heightened risk of widespread vaccine refusal.",0

"14191",14399,"As someone who works in the science communication world, I am really sad about this. In the past, I've helped some of our AMA guests IRL who were nervous about this whole Reddit thing. NASA scientists, professors, primatologists, etc. who were excited to expand their public engagement but otherwise would never have ventured onto a platform like Reddit. 

Most were more comfortable on other platforms. Yet, Reddit offered one of the best venues for real bi-directional engagement from the general public. Most of ""science Twitter"" are speaking to other scientists and science enthusiasts. Facebook Live is great but since there is no ""front page"" there is no way to find out about the fantastic science engagement from the platform itself. Which might be why so many FB Live science events feel successful if they have 20 viewers. And the vast majority of our science blogs are just read by our friends and family.

In contrast, Reddit was a space where scientists could have extended conversations that were in-depth, where those conversations were lasting resources that were easy to follow later, and access was low in data requirements for people on mobile. And, perhaps just as importantly, those AMAs could hit the front page bringing people into the conversation who might otherwise never have the opportunity or interest in speaking with a scientist with that area of expertise. Lots of great science doesn't make for flashy headlines. And those flashy headlines are often misleading. Our AMAs were an opportunity to mediate some of that. 

Every AMA guest I spoke with - even the really nervous ones - thought the AMA experience was wonderful by the end of it. All of you asked such thoughtful and engaging questions. And you showed your appreciation for the hours they took to respond. The AMAs were often the largest audiences these scientists ever had. Or might ever have again. And part of the reason they were such a great experience was all of you. 

Science communication has really lost something with the closing of these AMAs.

Looking at the statistics, the cancers you really have to worry about, in terms of death rates being &gt;~70% of incidence rates (excluding unspecified cases), are esophageal and pancreatic cancer, followed by lung, liver, ovarian and brain cancers. 

The biggest factor by far in the reduced cancer mortality rate since 1991 is the reduced incidence of smoking.   The reduction in deaths from lung cancer for men, at 40 per 100,000, is larger than the reduction from other causes for men and women combined.  (And majority of that reduction in death rate is not attributable to treatment.)

&gt; **Abstract:** Rising global temperatures are causing increases in the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events, such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. We analyze changes in summer temperatures, the frequency, severity, and duration of heat waves, and heat-related mortality in India between 1960 and 2009 using data from the India Meteorological Department. Mean temperatures across India have risen by more than 0.5°C over this period, with statistically significant increases in heat waves. Using a novel probabilistic model, we further show that the increase in summer mean temperatures in India over this period corresponds to a 146% increase in the probability of heat-related mortality events of more than 100 people. In turn, our results suggest that future climate warming will lead to substantial increases in heat-related mortality, particularly in developing low-latitude countries, such as India, where heat waves will become more frequent and populations are especially vulnerable to these extreme temperatures. Our findings indicate that even moderate increases in mean temperatures may cause great increases in heat-related mortality and support the efforts of governments and international organizations to build up the resilience of these vulnerable regions to more severe heat waves.",0

Abstract

&gt; This work examined window/door opening as means of bedroom ventilation and the consequent effect upon occupants' sleep, using data from 17 healthy volunteers. Bedroom CO2 level, temperature, and relative humidity were measured over 5 days, for two cases: open window or door (internal, bedroom door), and closed window and door. Participant filled questionnaires and sleep diary provided subjective measure of sleep quality. Actigraphy objectively monitored the participants during sleep. Additionally, a FlexSensor, placed under pillows of participants, detected movement during sleep. Average CO2 level for the Open conditions was 717 ppm (SD = 197 ppm) and for Closed conditions was 1150 ppm (SD = 463 ppm). Absolute humidity levels were similar for both conditions, while Open conditions were slightly cooler (mean = 19.7°C, SD = 1.8°C) than Closed (mean = 20.1°C, SD = 1.5°C). Results showed significant correlations (P &lt; .001) between actigraphy data and questionnaire responses for: sleep latency (r = .45), sleep length (r = .87), and number of awakenings (r = .28). Of all analyzed sleep parameters, questionnaire-based depth of sleep (P = .002) and actigraphy-based sleep phase (P = .003) were significantly different between Open and Closed conditions.

Practical Implications

&gt; The findings from this study help in understanding effectiveness of occupant-controlled ventilation strategies for bedroom environment, in terms of ensuing sleep. Such ventilation, even while employed for ensuring thermal comfort, can positively impact bedroom air quality. The results have implications for deciding upon suitable indoor climate quality for bedrooms and the means for achieving them. They also bear upon design of future field studies on sleep and indoor environment and how these studies may strive toward a more objective evaluation of sleep quality.",0

He was the only nurse on duty when the symptoms occurred. Since no other medical personnel were available, he performed and emailed his own electrocardiograms to an emergency physician by means of the Emergency Telehealth Service (ETS). The first electrocardiogram showed complete heart block, right bundle-branch block, hyperacute T waves in the inferior leads, and reciprocal ST-segment depression in the anterolateral leads (Figure 1A). The second electrocardiogram, obtained 50 minutes later, showed sinus tachycardia with 2 mm of inferior ST-segment elevation (Figure 1B).

&gt; He self-cannulated both antecubital fossae for intravenous access and self-administered aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, intravenous heparin, and opiates. Preparations were made for thrombolysis with tenecteplase, with real-time video interaction with the ETS. He attached his own defibrillator pads and prepared adrenaline, atropine, and amiodarone. After thrombolysis, there was resolution of his ST-segment elevation and symptoms.

Structure Basis for Directional R-loop Formation and Substrate Handover Mechanisms in Type I CRISPR-Cas System.

Abstract:

&gt; Type I CRISPR systems feature a sequential dsDNA target searching and degradation process, by crRNA-displaying Cascade and nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here we present two cryo-EM snapshots of the Thermobifida fusca type I-E Cascade: (1) unwinding 11 bp of dsDNA at the seed-sequence region to scout for sequence complementarity, and (2) further unwinding of the entire protospacer to form a full R-loop. These structures provide the much-needed temporal and spatial resolution to resolve key mechanistic steps leading to Cas3 recruitment. In the early steps, PAM recognition causes severe DNA bending, leading to spontaneous DNA unwinding to form a seed-bubble. The full R-loop formation triggers conformational changes in Cascade, licensing Cas3 to bind. The same process also generates a bulge in the non-target DNA strand, enabling its handover to Cas3 for cleavage. The combination of both negative and positive checkpoints ensures stringent yet efficient target degradation in type I CRISPR-Cas systems.

Interstingly the authors say nothing in the abstract about the dating prospects of the women they tested, creative or not. 

However in their conclusion at the end of the paper they say this:

&gt;By contrast, for women, two of the three experiments demonstrated that facial attractiveness enhanced their overall attractiveness to a greater extent than creativity (written expression and creative thinking) enhanced their overall attractiveness. Indeed, across these experiments, creativity weakened the appeal of women with less attractive faces and did not benefit their attractiveness when displayed by women with attractive faces. This former unexpected finding (weakening attractiveness judgements) may suggest evidence for subtle denigration of creative women based on (low) physical attractiveness, although caution is urged in this interpretation in light of the findings of the final experiment, where creativity strengthened the attractiveness of both men and women with less attractive faces but did not enhance the attractiveness of men or women with more attractive faces. Collectively, the data provide novel evidence that creativity in the form of spontaneous written expression and creative ideas may have specific effects on men's attractiveness as a potential mate and/or social partner, although further independent replications (i) with novel face stimulus sets, (ii) across modalities (e.g. measuring indices of vocal rather than facial attractiveness) and (iii) other forms of creative expression could help to clarify the extent to which these findings generalize to responses to men compared to women.",0

To summarize, they applied a difference-in-differences analysis, which is basically an ANOVA if you are familiar with that method. Originally all students at a school were permitted to legally purchase marijuana. At some point this was changed so that foreign students were not allowed, but local ones were. This allows the researchers to compare the difference in grades from before and after for local students against the difference in grades for foreign ones (hence, difference-in-differences). 

Note that this means that this is explicitly NOT a result saying that people who smoke weed do worse. The population for each group is (hopefully) roughly the same before and after the intervention. This is instead evidence that, *on average*, when college students' legal access to marijuana *is cut off*, they do better in school. Because of the natural experiment setup, this is not just a correlational result; it actually does provide causal evidence for its conclusion, though how strong you think that evidence is depends on how compelling you find the paper.

Abstract for convenience:

&gt;Tinder is a popular mobile dating app among young adults that may be used to facilitate meeting extradyadic partners. Participants who had used or were using Tinder (n = 550) indicated that most knew somebody who had used Tinder to meet extradyadic partners, and several participants reported that their own infidelity had been facilitated by Tinder. Participants were varied as to whether Tinder was an effective method for meeting extradyadic partners. Sociosexuality and intentions to engage in infidelity were associated with having used Tinder to engage in infidelity. Gender was not significantly associated with using Tinder to meet extradyadic partners when sociosexuality and intentions to engage in infidelity were also included in analyses.


And the Limitations and Conclusions section from the article

&gt;Like all research, the current study has limitations that should be noted. First, our sample was comprised of students attending one particular small city university and the findings cannot be generalized. For instance, Tinder may be more widely used to engage in infidelity among young adults not enrolled in college or by college students at more urban universities. Furthermore, social networks in other locations may not be nearly as concentrated as they were in the present study. Also,age is likely linked to whether and how individuals use Tinder. As a result, additional research with more diverse samples is needed to illuminate the use of Tinder as a facilitating method for engaging in infidelity in the general population.

&gt;Second, this study was cross-sectional and all data were collected in a single session. Other researchers might use longitudinal methods to examine how gender, sociosexual orientation, intentions to engage in infidelity, and other variables may prospectively predict use of Tinder for engaging in infidelity. Third, only a few types of extradyadic activities were assessed in the current study. For example, participants were asked if they messaged people on Tinder, but questions were not asked about the nature of these messages and whether participants shared sexual content. Future work should include a more exhaustive list of infidelity behaviors. Finally, the study only explored sociosexuality and intentions to engage in infidelity as predictors of infidelity. These variables were selected because the constructs are consistently and robustly linked to infidelity; however, future research might consider the role of additional constructs (e.g., the Big 5 personality traits, self-esteem, attachment orientations). Additional research may also examine how successful individuals are using Tinder to engage in infidelity and whether success rates differ with regard to gender and individual differences.

&gt;In conclusion, many young adults appear to be using Tinder as a means to engage in infidelity. Indeed, most young adults indicated that they knew somebody who had used Tinder to meet extradyadic partners and a non-negligible number of participants reported having engaged in infidelity via Tinder.

"3019",3052,"&gt;Many factors have been proposed to explain the attrition of women in science, technology, engineering and math fields, **among them the lower performance of women in introductory courses resulting from deficits in incoming preparation**. We focus on the impact of mixed methods of assessment, which minimizes the impact of high-stakes exams and rewards other methods of assessment such as group participation, low-stakes quizzes and assignments, and in-class activities. We hypothesized that these mixed methods would benefit individuals who otherwise underperform on high-stakes tests. Here, we analyze gender-based performance trends in nine large (N &gt; 1000 students) introductory biology courses in fall 2016. Females underperformed on exams compared to their male counterparts, **a difference that does not exist with other methods of assessment that compose course grade**. Further, we analyzed three case studies of courses that transitioned their grading schemes to either de-emphasize or emphasize exams as a proportion of total course grade. We demonstrate that the shift away from an exam emphasis consequently benefits female students, thereby closing gaps in overall performance. Further, the exam performance gap itself is reduced when the exams contribute less to overall course grade. We discuss testable predictions that follow from our hypothesis, and advocate for the use of mixed methods of assessments (possibly as part of an overall shift to active learning techniques). **We conclude by challenging the student deficit model, and suggest a course deficit model as explanatory of these performance gaps**, whereby the microclimate of the classroom can either raise or lower barriers to success for underrepresented groups in STEM.

&gt;Multiple lines of research indicate that fathers often treat boys and girls differently in ways that impact
child outcomes. The complex picture that has emerged, however, is obscured by methodological
challenges inherent to the study of parental caregiving, and no studies to date have examined the
possibility that gender differences in observed real-world paternal behavior are related to differential
paternal brain responses to male and female children. Here we compare fathers of daughters and fathers
of sons in terms of naturalistically observed everyday caregiving behavior and neural responses to child
picture stimuli. Compared with fathers of sons, fathers of daughters were more attentively engaged with
their daughters, sang more to their daughters, used more analytical language and language related to
sadness and the body with their daughters, and had a stronger neural response to their daughter's happy
facial expressions in areas of the brain important for reward and emotion regulation (medial and lateral
orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]). In contrast, fathers of sons engaged in more rough and tumble play (RTP),
used more achievement language with their sons, and had a stronger neural response to their son's neutral
facial expressions in the medial OFC (mOFC). Whereas the mOFC response to happy faces was
negatively related to RTP, the mOFC response to neutral faces was positively related to RTP, specifically
for fathers of boys. These results indicate that real-world paternal behavior and brain function differ as
a function of child gender.

"10916",11069,"I'm not going to advocate fracking but people really should learn what radiation is and how/when it's dangerous and when it's not. For starters radiation is a broad term related to electromagnetism. It includes photon radiation (the electromagnetic spectrum) and partical radiation (just what it sounds like, particals. Specifically protons, electrons and neutrons that aren't attached to an atom they're called free radicals). There are a number of things that happen to atoms to get them to emit photons and the energy of the photon correlates directly to its frequency and where it lands on the spectrum. Certain energies (like gamma), if they hit an atom, can give that atom's electrons enough energy to fly free. This changes the chemical properties of the atom, this is why certain frequencies can be dangerous in high enough intensities. Alpha and Beta (free protons and electrons) are dangerous because they have mass and can knock other electrons out of orbit or smash other nuclei of atoms apart (again changing their chemical properties). Gamma tends to pass through all but the densest of materials (which is why lead stops it), which means it takes a rather large intensity before the probability of it hitting you instead of passing through is high enough to be of concern and it's pretty rare. Alpha and Beta can be blocked by your skin and clothes, so an long as it's not in the air and you don't ingest/inject it, you'll be fine as long as you get it off/away from you before you ingest/inject it.",0

By analogy, would this be similar to the indirect measurement of Jupiter's mass and orbit by measuring the perturbations to the orbits of Mars, the asteroids, and the outer planets?

But in this case, the total probability field of the system does not collapse, nor that of the quantum particle itself, because we do not directly measure it. Instead we measure other particles that are or were affected by the first particle. As I understand it, measuring another particle would have to cause a local probability field collapse for the measured particle, no collapse for the 1st particle  and only partial collapse of the total probability field of the system under study. Without access to the body of the Physics A Review paper, I am curious as to how this is possible.

I gather that these measurements allow us to determine *some* counterfactual characteristics of the first particle. This suggests that counterfactual parameters may be real, a very interesting concept.",0

This is a very important contextual point, and I think makes the study perfectly valid; it's just not as broad as many would like it to be. Further research should definitely look at differences in suicide ideation between planned and unplanned pregnancies, as well as further dividing the differences between those who are certain they don't want/need an abortion, those who are uncertain (at various stages of pregnancy), and those who definitely want one.

"17013",17263,"I think there is an important distinction that needs to be made relevant to this topic. Coarsely put, there are two types of ""square peg"" kids, as in not popular. One type is a square peg type that maybe envies some of the privileges of popularity, but is generally happy how they are and how it allows them to enjoy some square-peg pastimes -- role playing games, etc. -- easily. They genuinely love their friends and their hobbies and interests and wouldn't really trade it for a different life.

The second group are more unhappy with their situation, and what they do and who they are friends with is more of a reaction to their lack of ""popularity"" than in the first group. (Ironically, this is the group of people who are often more vocally denigrating of what the ""popular"" kids like or are like, but a lot of this is sour grapes.) Despite protestations otherwise, sometimes loud and rebellious ones, deep down they want to be liked by the popular kids and the exclusion really hurts them. They do not make good or stable friendships as easily as the first group, and often find themselves in the company of those like themselves. Largely what they have in common with their friends is merely not being popular, and a sense of self-loathing about this. These people also have trouble dating and will fall into numerous less-than-healthy short-term relationships and suffer a great deal from unrequited crushes that may turn into infatuations or even obsessions. The first group, by contrast, general dates within the emotionally healthy square-peggy group and don't have that many issues like this.

I can easily see how kids from the first group would have some of the happiest and most satisfying lives, because they figured out one of the big secrets early: you really shouldn't care that much what other people think about who you are and what you like. ""Popular"" people are often very preoccupied with appearances, competition, and the status quo, which can lead to less happiness. Kids from the second group of square pegs, though, may have a worse time than anyone.",0

___

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Surface meltwater drains across ice sheets, forming melt ponds that can trigger ice-shelf collapse, acceleration of grounded ice flow and increased sea-level rise. Numerical models of the Antarctic Ice Sheet that incorporate meltwater's impact on ice shelves, but ignore the movement of water across the ice surface, predict a metre of global sea-level rise this century in response to atmospheric warming. To understand the impact of water moving across the ice surface a broad quantification of surface meltwater and its drainage is needed. Yet, despite extensive research in Greenland and observations of individual drainage systems in Antarctica, we have little understanding of Antarctic-wide surface hydrology or how it will evolve. Here we show widespread drainage of meltwater across the surface of the ice sheet through surface streams and ponds (hereafter 'surface drainage') as far south as 85° S and as high as 1,300 metres above sea level. Our findings are based on satellite imagery from 1973 onwards and aerial photography from 1947 onwards. Surface drainage has persisted for decades, transporting water up to 120 kilometres from grounded ice onto and across ice shelves, feeding vast melt ponds up to 80 kilometres long. Large-scale surface drainage could deliver water to areas of ice shelves vulnerable to collapse, as melt rates increase this century. While Antarctic surface melt ponds are relatively well documented on some ice shelves, we have discovered that ponds often form part of widespread, large-scale surface drainage systems. In a warming climate, enhanced surface drainage could accelerate future ice-mass loss from Antarctic, potentially via positive feedbacks between the extent of exposed rock, melting and thinning of the ice sheet.


Study: [Antarctic ice shelf potentially stabilized by export of meltwater in surface river](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v544/n7650/full/nature22048.html)
___

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Meltwater stored in ponds and crevasses can weaken and fracture ice shelves, triggering their rapid disintegration. This ice-shelf collapse results in an increased flux of ice from adjacent glaciers and ice streams, thereby raising sea level globally. However, surface rivers forming on ice shelves could potentially export stored meltwater and prevent its destructive effects. Here we present evidence for persistent active drainage networks-interconnected streams, ponds and rivers-on the Nansen Ice Shelf in Antarctica that export a large fraction of the ice shelf's meltwater into the ocean. We find that active drainage has exported water off the ice surface through waterfalls and dolines for more than a century. The surface river terminates in a 130-metre-wide waterfall that can export the entire annual surface melt over the course of seven days. During warmer melt seasons, these drainage networks adapt to changing environmental conditions by remaining active for longer and exporting more water. Similar networks are present on the ice shelf in front of Petermann Glacier, Greenland, but other systems, such as on the Larsen C and Amery Ice Shelves, retain surface water at present. The underlying reasons for export versus retention remain unclear. Nonetheless our results suggest that, in a future warming climate, surface rivers could export melt off the large ice shelves surrounding Antarctica-contrary to present Antarctic ice-sheet models, which assume that meltwater is stored on the ice surface where it triggers ice-shelf disintegration.",0

Data were drawn from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, a birth cohort of 2232 individuals born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995. Loneliness was measured when participants were aged 18. Regression analyses were used to test concurrent associations between loneliness and health and functioning in young adulthood. Longitudinal analyses were conducted to examine childhood factors associated with young adult loneliness.

Results

Lonelier young adults were more likely to experience mental health problems, to engage in physical health risk behaviours, and to use more negative strategies to cope with stress. They were less confident in their employment prospects and were more likely to be out of work. Lonelier young adults were, as children, more likely to have had mental health difficulties and to have experienced bullying and social isolation. Loneliness was evenly distributed across genders and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Conclusions

Young adults' experience of loneliness co-occurs with a diverse range of problems, with potential implications for health in later life. The findings underscore the importance of early intervention to prevent lonely young adults from being trapped in loneliness as they age.

A quick thought on the science. People have been trying to clone monkeys without success for quite a while now. There was a fair bit of disappointment when people learned that cloning a monkey would not be nearly as easy as it was to clone a sheep (and even that was hard). The researchers used a number of epigenetic modulators to get the cloning to work, and even then it was quite inefficient - it took 127 eggs to produce two live macaque births.

The full research article, [*Cloning of Macaque Monkeys by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer*](http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-86741830057-6) is published in the journal, Cell.

**Abstract**

Generation of genetically uniform non-human primates may help to establish animal models for primate biology and biomedical research. In this study, we have successfully cloned cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). We found that injection of H3K9me3 demethylase Kdm4d mRNA and treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A at one-cell stage following SCNT greatly improved blastocyst development and pregnancy rate of transplanted SCNT embryos in surrogate monkeys. For SCNT using fetal monkey fibroblasts, 6 pregnancies were confirmed in 21 surrogates and yielded 2 healthy babies. For SCNT using adult monkey cumulus cells, 22 pregnancies were confirmed in 42 surrogates and yielded 2 babies that were short-lived. In both cases, genetic analyses confirmed that the nuclear DNA and mitochondria DNA of the monkey offspring originated from the nucleus donor cell and the oocyte donor monkey, respectively. Thus, cloning macaque monkeys by SCNT is feasible using fetal fibroblasts.

"11547",11708,"I've volunteered at a crisis centre in my city where we answered calls from people in distress, and we had a special line dedicated to those intending to commit suicide. One of the biggest takeaways I got from my training there is that we MUST talk about suicide. Bring it out of the shadows and take away the taboo. We can't be afraid to ask people if they want to kill themselves, and we must be willing to ask them, point blank, ""Are you thinking of suicide? Are you thinking of killing yourself?""    
I don't agree with school administrators, policy makers, or entertainment watchdogs that are calling for the show to be banned, and to forbid kids from watching it. What I DO think, is that kids should not watch this show on their own, that they should be watching it with a trusted adult who will talk candidly with them about the events in the show. It should be a tool for communication wherein both kids and adults can ask questions and talk openly about suicide.    
Yes, I would say that the show dramatizes and even romanticizes suicide in a way, but it IS a television show after all. There is also some very graphic rapes scenes in the show, perpetrated by a popular character who seemingly gets away with it; is this likely to increase the number of rapes if kids think they can get away with it because they saw it on a show? I think not. But that is all the more reason to talk with kids about what is real and what is fantasy in regards to suicide.    
If we start banning TV shows and forbidding kids from watching them on the grounds that they are controversial, you know that is likely to just make them want to watch it more and they will hunt it down, stream it, download it, and watch it secretly, without the opportunity to talk to anyone about what they see for fear of getting in trouble, and because that's just what kids do. What will we do next? Ban them from watching the news when one of their favourite singers or actors commits suicide? Someone who seemly has everything: fame, money, prestige, but still decides to kill themselves, because we are afraid that it will cause kids to kill themselves?    
The whole argument that people are influenced by what they watch, and that kids who watch shows about suicide will be influenced to kill themselves, is no different than the argument people have made in the past that playing violent video games makes people violent, or that listening to Eminem makes people misogynistic.     
People that kill themselves or engage in other acts of self-harm likely already had those thoughts. Watching a TV show won't make them do something they hadn't already decided to do; however, people are more likely to commit suicide following the suicide of someone they were close to or idolized. It makes me wonder if anyone had looked into the increase of internet searches on suicide after the death of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington, or Robin Williams? No one seems to be concerned with suicide epidemics among at risk youth in poor neighbourhoods or isolated communities like what is happening with First Nations kids, who are killing themselves in droves.    
Suicide should not be a taboo topic. We should all be talking about it. The conversation has started because of this show, but the focus is all wrong. Instead of worrying so much about a TV show supposedly increasing the number of internet searches on how to kill oneself, maybe we should be talking about WHY kids feel like suicide is the answer.

ABSTRACT

&gt; High-income countries are grappling with the challenge of caring for aging populations, many of whose members have chronic illnesses and declining capacity to manage activities of daily living. The 2017 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of Older Adults in eleven countries showed that US seniors were sicker than their counterparts in other countries and, despite universal coverage under Medicare, faced more financial barriers to health care. The survey's findings also highlight economic hardship and mental health problems that may affect older adults' health, use of care, and outcomes. They show that in some countries, one in five elderly people have unmet needs for social care services-a gap that can undermine health. New to the survey is a focus on the ""high-need"" elderly (those with multiple chronic conditions or functional limitations), who reported high rates of emergency department use and care coordination failures. Across all eleven countries, many high-need elderly people expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of health care they had received.",0

"2151",2177,"A new computer model of wealth creation confirms that the most successful people are not necessarily the most talented or smartest, but just the luckiest.  Two Italian physicists, Alessandro Pluchino and Andrea Rapisarda, and one economist, A. E. Biondo, created an agent\-based model, called ""Talent vs Luck"".

&gt;. it's the good old **""bell curve"": the ""normal distribution."" Most human traits are arrayed along it. But wealth, the authors write, follows something called a power law, also sometimes called the ""80/20 rule,"" with a vast majority of poor people and a very small number of billionaires. The richest eight men having wealth equal to something like 3\+ billion of the world's poorest would be an extreme but telling example.**  
&gt;  
&gt;But think about it, the authors suggest. **If smarts and talents and even effort are so normally distributed and wealth is so abnormally distributed, what's missing to explain the disparity?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""We suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness,**"" write the authors. ""**In particular, we show that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success, being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals.**"" The practical implication is pretty clear: ""It underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors or resources to people who, **at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others.""**

Here is a link to the research article, [**Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068), it's an open\-access article. Below the copypasta of the abstract:

&gt;The largely dominant meritocratic paradigm of highly competitive Western cultures is rooted on the belief that success is due mainly, if not exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent, intelligence, skills, efforts or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material success. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the importance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well known that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among the population, whereas the distribution of wealth \- considered a proxy of success \- follows typically a power law \(Pareto law\). Such a discrepancy between a Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale, and the scale invariant distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind the scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent\-based model, we suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success, being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our knowledge, this counterintuitive result \- although implicitly suggested between the lines in a vast literature \- is quantified here for the first time. It sheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit on the basis of the reached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others. With the help of this model, several policy hypotheses are also addressed and compared to show the most efficient strategies for public funding of research in order to improve meritocracy, diversity and innovation.

I always ask devout people about traumatic events in their lives and about their upbringing. I have also witnessed the turn several times in my life.

"18806",19087,"It's pretty interesting that the network has small world characteristics, but not super surprising. Most human networks have small world connections. The easiest way to describe that is a node (in this case, an anti-vaxxer) with many short connections (close friends within a similar circle) and few long-range connections (presumably family and high school friends in much different social circles).

Small world networks were named by Stanley Milgram (yes, the obedience guy), who ran into a man who lived in the same town he did while on vacation in London. You know, the kind of chance encounter that makes you say, ""Small world!"" Milgram noticed that these occurrences happened more often than he felt they should and set up a study to discern the average number of people through which two completely unconnected people are linked. He asked people in two randomly selected towns in the Midwest to get letters to people on the East Coast who they did not know. To get them there, they were instructed to send their letters to someone who they thought would be closer than they were. The average number of links was 6, which gives rise to the 6 degrees of separation thing with actors and the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon game (I'm only three degrees from him, btw). Milgram noted that most people have a lot of short-range, local connections and a few looking connections that span great distances. Graph theorists and neuroscientists began using the terminology when they noticed that other networks, including neurons, have the same structure. Buszaki (sp?) suggests that, while most neural connections are short and local, the brain can be spanned in just six long-range jumps, just like people. In terms of neurons, that structure prevents deleterious damage while also promoting efficient sharing of ""information"" (electrochemical potential).

 Astronomers Shed Light on Formation of Black Holes and Galaxies

( Image of the quasar host galaxy from the UC San Diego research team's data. The distance to this quasar galaxy is ~9.3 billion light years. The four-color image shows findings from use of the Keck Observatory and ALMA. As seen from Keck Observatory, the green colors highlight the energetic gas across the galaxy that is being illuminated by the quasar. The blue color represents powerful winds blowing throughout the galaxy. The red-orange colors represent the cold molecular gas in the system as seen from ALMA. The supermassive black hole sits at the center of the bright red-orange circular area slightly below the middle of the image. https://i.imgur.com/WcR00Bc.png )

Maunakea, Hawaii - Stars forming in galaxies appear to be influenced by the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, but the mechanism of how that happens has not been clear to astronomers until now.

""Supermassive black holes are captivating,"" says lead author Shelley Wright, a University of California San Diego Professor of Physics. ""Understanding why and how galaxies are affected by their supermassive black holes is an outstanding puzzle in their formation.""

In a study published today in The Astrophysical Journal, Wright, graduate student Andrey Vayner, and their colleagues examined the energetics surrounding the powerful winds generated by the bright, vigorous supermassive black hole (known as a ""quasar"") at the center of the 3C 298 host galaxy, located approximately 9.3 billion light years away.

""We study supermassive black holes in the very early universe when they are actively growing by accreting massive amounts of gaseous material,"" says Wright. ""While black holes themselves do not emit light, the gaseous material they chew on is heated to extreme temperatures, making them the most luminous objects in the universe.""

The UC San Diego team's research revealed that the winds blow out through the entire galaxy and impact the growth of stars.

""This is remarkable that the supermassive black hole is able to impact stars forming at such large distances,"" says Wright.

Today, neighboring galaxies show that the galaxy mass is tightly correlated with the supermassive black hole mass. Wright's and Vayner's research indicates that 3C 298 does not fall within this normal scaling relationship between nearby galaxies and the supermassive black holes that lurk at their center. But, in the early universe, their study shows that the 3C 298 galaxy is 100 times less massive than it should be given its behemoth supermassive black hole mass.

This implies that the supermassive black hole mass is established well before the galaxy, and potentially the energetics from the quasar are capable of controlling the growth of the galaxy.

To conduct the study, the UC San Diego researchers utilized multiple state-of-the-art astronomical facilities. The first of these was Keck Observatory's instrument OSIRIS (OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph) and its advanced adaptive optics (AO) system. An AO system allows ground-based telescopes to achieve higher quality images by correcting for the blurring caused by the Earth's atmosphere. The resulting images are as good as those obtained from space.

The second major facility was the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, known as ""ALMA,"" an international observatory in Chile that is able to detect millimeter wavelengths using up to 66 antennae to achieve high-resolution images of the gas surrounding the quasar.

""The most enjoyable part of researching this galaxy has been putting together all the data from different wavelengths and techniques,"" said Vayner. ""Each new dataset that we obtained on this galaxy answered one question and helped us put some of the pieces of the puzzle together. However, at the same time, it created new questions about the nature of galaxy and supermassive black hole formation.""

Wright agreed, saying that the data sets were ""tremendously gorgeous"" from both Keck Observatory and ALMA, offering a wealth of new information about the universe.

These findings are the first results from a larger survey of distant quasars and their energetics' impact on star formation and galaxy growth. Vayner and the team will continue developing results on more distant quasars using the new facilities and capabilities from Keck Observatory and ALMA.


ABOUT OSIRIS

The OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph (OSIRIS) is one of W. M. Keck Observatory's ""integral field spectrographs."" The instrument works behind the adaptive optics system, and uses an array of lenslets to sample a small rectangular patch of the sky at resolutions approaching the diffraction limit of the 10-meter Keck Telescope. OSIRIS records an infrared spectrum at each point within the patch in a single exposure, greatly enhancing its efficiency and precision when observing small objects such as distant galaxies. It is used to characterize the dynamics and composition of early stages of galaxy formation.



ABOUT W. M. KECK OBSERVATORY


The W. M. Keck Observatory telescopes are among the most scientifically productive on Earth. The two, 10-meter optical/infrared telescopes on the summit of Maunakea on the Island of Hawaii feature a suite of advanced instruments including imagers, multi-object spectrographs, high-resolution spectrographs, integral-field spectrometers, and world-leading laser guide star adaptive optics systems.

Some of the data presented herein were obtained at Keck Observatory, which is a private 501(c) 3 non-profit organization operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

The authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of Maunakea has always had within the indigenous Hawaiian community. We are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain.

Based on the U.S.'s official definition of poverty, *14.5%* of Americans are impoverished.  This 1% statistic leaves out the overwhelming majority of the impoverished -- which means we're dealing with a very different group than the average person in poverty struggling to get by from day-to-day.  

The bottom 1% are mostly the homeless, the mentally troubled, the drug and drink addicts -- the people who quite predictably have shorter lifespans, on average, for reasons that often have little or nothing to do with poverty per se.  So what's being measured here is conflating the impact of poverty itself with many other factors that are likely more important, making the statistic virtually meaningless.

Same with the fact that these people are being compared to the top 1%.  The fact that the top 1% income-earners live a lot longer doesn't necessarily mean *poverty* is a predictor of early death.  It could just as easily mean that being extremely rich means you get top-notch medical care compared to almost *everyone* else -- not just the impoverished.  

If this were really a good-faith study of the impact of poverty, it would be comparing the average lifespan of the bottom 14.5% of income-earners to the overall average, and controlling for other factors affecting lifespan that have nothing to do with poverty.",0

Ok so we gonna need to extract roughly 4000Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere **that we do nothing with** until 2100. That means we need 50,000 plants fully operational now. We don't have that. So let's say we build all the plants we need in the coming 20 years. That means we only have 60 years to let them run, so we need to build 67,000 plants instead. But wait there's more, running these plants will also produce 2000Gt CO2 from the burning of natural gas... So effectively we only capture 0.5 Mt CO2 per year and plant. So we need not 67,000 plants, but 130,000 plants.

Ok, the extraction cost is $150/t-CO2, so that's $1200 trillion, about 7% of the world GDP from 2040 to 2100 assuming 2.5% annual growth. The electricity needed will be 2 million TWh, or 12% the energy that the world produces in 60 years assuming 1.67% annual energy production growth. The plants will require 4600 km^(3) of natural gas, or 2.6% of our reserves.

And all this, is *just* to avoid climate catastrophe, none of this leads to ""carbon neutral transportation fuel"", if you want to do that you have to build a lot more plants and use more natural gas.

Abstract

Chondroitinase ABC is a promising preclinical therapy that promotes functional neuroplasticity after CNS injury by degrading extracellular matrix inhibitors. Efficient delivery of chondroitinase ABC to the injured mammalian spinal cord can be achieved by viral vector transgene delivery. This approach dramatically modulates injury pathology and restores sensorimotor functions. However, clinical development of this therapy is limited by a lack of ability to exert control over chondroitinase gene expression. Prior experimental gene regulation platforms are likely to be incompatible with the non-resolving adaptive immune response known to occur following spinal cord injury. Therefore, here we apply a novel immune-evasive dual vector system, in which the chondroitinase gene is under a doxycycline inducible regulatory switch, utilizing a chimeric transactivator designed to evade T cell recognition. Using this novel vector system, we demonstrate tight temporal control of chondroitinase ABC gene expression, effectively removing treatment upon removal of doxycycline. This enables a comparison of short and long-term gene therapy paradigms in the treatment of clinically-relevant cervical level contusion injuries in adult rats. We reveal that transient treatment (2.5 weeks) is sufficient to promote improvement in sensory axon conduction and ladder walking performance. However, in tasks requiring skilled reaching and grasping, only long term treatment (8 weeks) leads to significantly improved function, with rats able to accurately grasp and retrieve sugar pellets. The late emergence of skilled hand function indicates enhanced neuroplasticity and connectivity and correlates with increased density of vGlut1+ innervation in spinal cord grey matter, particularly in lamina III-IV above and below the injury. Thus, our novel gene therapy system provides an experimental tool to study temporal effects of extracellular matrix digestion as well as an encouraging step towards generating a safer chondroitinase gene therapy strategy, longer term administration of which increases neuroplasticity and recovery of descending motor control. This preclinical study could have a significant impact for tetraplegic individuals, for whom recovery of hand function is an important determinant of independence, and supports the ongoing development of chondroitinase gene therapy towards clinical application for the treatment of spinal cord injury.",0

"2369",2396,"Ad hominems are sometimes legitimate arguments. They are fallacies only in the case of syllogistic logical arguments, not for empirical claims.
When someone is constructing a syllogism based on axioms that are agreed upon by all participants in a conversation, the only thing that matters is whether the logical steps taken from the axioms to the conclusion were valid. There is no need to trust the individual making the argument because the arguments stand on their own.

This is not the case with empirical claims which depend on observation. In order to trust a scientific study, you have to believe that A) the scientists didn't falsify their data and B) they didn't surreptitiously bias their conclusions with statistical/mathematical sleight of hand. Most of the time when people - even scientists - read scientific papers, we don't reproduce the experiments ourselves or delve into the Methods section to figure out whether the analysis was correct in every detail. To a large degree we rely on a sense of trust that scientists operate in good faith with the aim of discovering truth and wouldn't do anything to misrepresent the reality of their observations. If there is reason to suspect a scientist's credibility isn't warranted, that's a very good reason to distrust their research as well.

Obviously, I have more reason to suspect a study commissioned by the NFL about TBI or a study commissioned by Coca Cola about sugar consumption about fudging their data or lying with statistics than independent research conducted at a university.

Abstract

&gt;OBJECTIVES:

&gt;Sleep quality may be directly related with vitamin D serum level. Some studies found that people with lower vitamin D serum level experienced a lower sleep quality. Consequently, this study aimed at determining the effect of vitamin D supplements on sleep score and quality in 20-50 year-old people with sleep disorders.

&gt;METHODS:

&gt;This double blind, clinical trial was performed in November 2015-February 2016 on 89 people with sleep disorders based on Petersburg's Sleep Index. Patient samples were divided randomly into two groups: intervention and placebo. At the end of the study, the data on 89 subjects (44 in intervention group and 45 people in placebo group) were examined. Intervention group received a 50 000-unit vitamin D supplement, one in a fortnight for 8 weeks. Meanwhile, placebo group received placebo. Before and after intervention, Petersburg's Sleep Quality Questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, general information questionnaire, sun exposure, vitamin D serum level and 3-day food record questionnaire were assessed and recorded for all participants. To analyze data, t-test, chi square, ANCOVA, U-Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon statistical tests were used.

&gt;FINDINGS:

&gt;Based on the results of the present study, at the end of the study sleep score (PSQI) reduced significantly in vitamin recipients as compared with placebo recipients (P &lt; 0.05). This difference was significant even after modifying confounding variables (P &lt; 0.05).

&gt;CONCLUSION:

&gt;This study shows that the use of vitamin D supplement improves sleep quality, reduces sleep latency, raises sleep duration and improves subjective sleep quality in people of 20-50 year-old with sleep disorder.

"12131",12308,"&gt;We tested whether conservatives and liberals are similarly or differentially likely to deny scientific claims that conflict with their preferred conclusions. Participants were randomly assigned to read about a study with correct results that were either consistent or inconsistent with their attitude about one of several issues (e.g., carbon emissions). Participants were asked to interpret numerical results and decide what the study concluded. After being informed of the correct interpretation, participants rated how much they agreed with, found knowledgeable, and trusted the researchers' correct interpretation. Both liberals and conservatives engaged in motivated interpretation of study results and denied the correct interpretation of those results when that interpretation conflicted with their attitudes. Our study suggests that the same motivational processes underlie differences in the political priorities of those on the left and the right.

"10512",10661,"I have some questions regarding the value of expanded gender concepts from a medical perspective.

So from a medical standpoint what are the advantages of considering gender beyond that of sex? Is there a sufficiently large correlation between gender identity and biological differences between them and people of same sex (but different gender identity)? How do you account for socially developed gender identity (Culture/society can cause a person to feel different about themselves, thus I would postulate they may have developed their gender identity around such encounters rather than purely biological reasons)?

In case the answer is that gender identity helps diagnose psychological issues such as depression or anxiety: To what extend are these caused more by societies nonacceptance of their unique personality/biology, rather than their biology making them more prone to depression/anxiety? Could larger understanding that individuals don't necessarily conform to stereotypes (such as traditional gender roles[male/female]) help mitigate this? (as opposed to expanding our concept of gender.) What advantage does ""gender identity"" hold when attempting to help these people come to terms with their differences? 

Lastly, aren't all people non-binary to some extend? As in, we all exhibit some traits commonly attributed to the opposite sex, it's simply a question of how much. Wouldn't the underlying issue then be our persistence in trying to apply stereotypes to individuals? I have traits that are very feminine, but see no reason to classify myself as anything other than male [as per my sexual organs, which is all I see gender to be] (not trying to say others do not exhibit a much stronger dissonance, just as an example of the issue being cultural rather than biological). All humans are bound to be a unique result of our biology and experiences, and our biology doesn't care about gender roles. We then attempt to conform to societal expectations (perhaps due to the advantages this brings when dealing  with other people), so men attempt to become more masculine and women more feminine. This would lead me to think the issue is our culture of over stereotyping, and the solution is to change that part in culture not expand gender (a stereotype to begin with) to encompass more possibilities.

Additional question: I see gender as an inherently flawed concept since biological sex organs are a poor indicator of biological diversity and its consequent effect on personality. Is it realistic to expand our concept of gender in a way that it would be ""less flawed"" in describing our biology's effect on character (won't some amount of people always feel inadequate in any of the categories [and thus feel discriminated against] and won't the pressure to find your own ""cateogry"" eventually overshadow the advantages?)

A conspiracy theorist is one who beleives there is a hidden agenda to political and government events and occurrences, there's nothing objectively crazy about that. The crazy occurs on the level of the individual. 
People preach about not punishing the actions of an entire group if there's one person in that group who has malicious intent with their words and actions, like religious extremists for example. 
This philosophy crumbles when people believe their core opinions and perspectives are being questioned, and it's created a coective agreement that we need to shun conspiracy theorists without considering that there may be any weight to their arguments.

Well that depends what algorithm you use. If you use a decision tree, then you can very easily see and interpret what happens in between.

&gt; That makes it difficult for humans to tweak the algorithm

Humans shouldn't be manually tweaking the algorithm beyond data preprocessing and hyper parameters anyway. All you want is to maximize AUC or minimize some other loss function, with maybe asymmetrical weighting on false negative/positive results.

&gt; it thwarts predictions of what it will do in a new scenario.

"13113",13302,"I don't understand what supposedly passes for ""science"" now, but this study is effectively useless, and the ""helicopter parenting"" title is extremely clickbait-y.

Firstly, ""helicopter parenting"" in this case means only mothers (sorry dads), and only mothers who showed their toddler what to do rather than letting them free play on their own during a SINGLE 6 minute play session when the kids were 2. ONE SESSION. That is hardly enough observation to categorize someone as a ""helicopter parent"" with any intellectual honesty, but the study used exactly 0 other input (not even a self-reporting questionnaire) to make that designation.

Secondly, the mothers could have easily felt on the spot by being in a laboratory under watching eyes and felt that they needed to be more involved than they normally are. It in no way can be reasonably drawn that the mothers dominate their child's playtime all the time, let alone that they are ""over-controlling"" in other aspects of the child's life and attempt to dominate their children's emotions or shelter them from anything negative in their life, which is the presumption in the study's finding.

Not to mention, the study took place over an 8-year span and made no account for changes in parenting style or any other major life changes encountered by the subjects. Assuming that parental relationships and subjects' lives remain constant for 8 years seems dishonest and like a lazy attempt to desperately pursue a study and its conclusions despite not accounting for the complexity that is life and childhood experiences.

For many of us, the idea that over-controlling parents are more likely to raise kids who are less independent and emotionally strong makes sense, but this study is incredibly weak in providing any real evidence for what exactly constitutes being over-controlling and what connection that may or may not actually have on child development.",0

Title: Nature and origins of the lexicon in 6-mo-olds

Authors: Elika Bergelson  and Richard N. Aslin

Abstract:

Recent research reported the surprising finding that even 6-mo-olds understand common nouns [Bergelson E, Swingley D (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109:3253-3258]. However, is their early lexicon structured and acquired like older learners? We test 6-mo-olds for a hallmark of the mature lexicon: cross-word relations. We also examine whether properties of the home environment that have been linked with lexical knowledge in older children are detectable in the initial stage of comprehension. We use a new dataset, which includes in-lab comprehension and home measures from the same infants. We find evidence for cross-word structure: On seeing two images of common nouns, infants looked significantly more at named target images when the competitor images were semantically unrelated (e.g., milk and foot) than when they were related (e.g., milk and juice), just as older learners do. We further find initial evidence for home-lab links: common noun ""copresence"" (i.e., whether words' referents were present and attended to in home recordings) correlated with in-lab comprehension. These findings suggest that, even in neophyte word learners, cross-word relations are formed early and the home learning environment measurably helps shape the lexicon from the outset.

All they mean by gender flexibility is the extent to which people think men/women/boys/girls *should or shouldn't* like/do something. It means not giving a shit if someone wants to do something counter-stereotypical. It *doesn't* mean support for injecting physically healthy children with hormones to manipulate the course of puberty and it doesn't mean pretending that there aren't differences in the average behavior of the different sexes.

My reply:

&gt;I apologize because you're right that I gave an unfair representation of the position of which I am skeptical. What I should have said is that supporting the socialization of gender flexibility doesn't require one to believe that it is acceptable/healthy to interfere with the biological maturation of children or minors. That said, there are absolutely people who believe that it is acceptable to use hormones to alter the trajectory of puberty in physiologically healthy children and there are absolutely people who believe that sex differences are entirely socialized. I think both claims are dubious, but **my main point is that I would be willing to set aside my skepticism of both of those positions to cooperate in favor of promoting gender flexible attitudes. We can sidestep this whole issue in favor of progress.**",0

""Tattoo ink nanoparticles in skin tissue and fibroblasts"".
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4464189

Starting points for the above article are:
1. Tattoo inks contain nanoparticles, which have higher levels of chemical activity than larger particles.

2. Not much research has been done into the toxicity of tattoo inks, so we know very little about the biochemical reactivity of ink particles with skin cells and tissues (plus constituent components, like fibroblasts and associated collagen fibrillar networks).

3. Ink manufactures are not obliged to disclose the contents of their ink.

Interesting read.

But it could be argued that mass tattoo uptake is peaking as cultural &amp; fashion saturation points are reached. So any significant effects of chemicals being pumped into the dermis might only affect one or 2 generations (the recent upsurge in large-scale / populist tattoo usage) and then be forgotten as fashions move on.

"6290",6374,"I don't post often but I feel like I had to give my input here. I am a physician in Canada who works in intensive care and trauma with an interest in traumatic brain injury. This article is horribly misleading. The implication is that care is being withdrawn inappropriately on patients in a minimally conscious state rather than a vegetative state. What the writer of the article doesn't understand is that these descriptions (I believe first described in the 1975 Lancet article by Jennett https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/46957/ if you want more description of them) described two different levels of SEVERE cognitive impairment with minimal function. They are two parts of the same severely impaired side of the scale.

What I think they are trying to make this seem like is a ""locked in syndrome"" where someone is aware and cognitively intact but unable to communicate (like the classic novel The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly). Although this does happen, it is exceedingly rare.

Patients who are minimally conscious very minimally interact with their surroundings and likely have little understanding of what's going on around them. Withdrawal of life support measures is very appropriate in many cases, as it likely was for the patient in the article. These patients are NOT returning to their previous functional level or anything close and they will always be heavily dependent on care.

The BMC neurology article punlished in 2009 cited by the paper is actually quite reasonable and simply relates to the diagnostic accuracy of determining which of these two devestating states the patient is in. However, even the better of these two is still an unrecoverable tremendous head injury.

This article is misleading and by either ignorance or malice is going to trick people into thinking that 40% of people with a vegetative state are actually more in keeping with a locked-in syndrome (the article quotes a medical ethicist as saying ""Lying in bed, aware of your surroundings but unable to communicate"", which is misleading and inaccurate in these cases). This diagnosis does to some extent affect prognosis and more accuracy should be sought but this article strikes me as either politically or religiously motivated given its heavy handed statements. This type of article really makes me worry about the already difficult task of recommending withdrawal in many if these patients. For the majority of people I don't believe it's how they'd want to live their lives and this type of false hope means more people will be damned to a perpetuated existence in this state by well-meaning family members.

"12546",12730,"Interesting, I vaguely know at least one of the authors, but as is so often the case, the headline is a simplfication to the point of innacuracy.

Really what this says is that a bit over half of a certain group of NHS patients treated with a low-key intervention showed evidence of relapse or recurrence within a year. To describe those people as ""more than half of mental health NHS patients"" is wildly misleading.

The [original article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717300840) has a far more accurate but less attention-grabbing title:

""How durable is the effect of low intensity CBT for depression and anxiety? Remission and relapse in a longitudinal cohort study""

However, I am certain that there is a lot of truth in it. A lot of current mental health NHS interventions work on teh ""never mind the quality feel the width"" principle.

Go back over 10 years, and doctors, especially GPs, were facing a lot of criticism for prescribing antidepressants for patients where psychotherapy might well be appropriate. This was countered with the undeniable fact that, in most areas, the wait for psychotehrapy was at least a year, and often more than two years. Therefore, GPs referred few people For psychotherapy, they used the tools available to them (pills) not those well out of reach.

To give them credit, the last labour government acknowledged this, one of the few genuinely good things that they did for healthcare. They set up IAPT services - Imrpving Access to Psychological Therapies, so people could be seen far quicker.

However, they really had little idea How many people GPs were treating. Once there was a more accessible service available, GPs used it - indeed, they were duty bound to when it was the most appropriate service for their patients. So NHS management suddenly found that there was this huge pool of unmet need, not just the small pool who had been waiting 1-2 years or more for the existing provision.

So, as so often happens, the emphasis was changed from quality of treatment to a numbers game (I really don't mean this as a criticism of the therapists themselves, they work very hard, in most cases to do the best with the time they are given. But, of course, you can't really do the best psychotherapy quickly.) Feed as many through the system as quickly as we can get away with is how things have gone. So these findings don't really surprise me.

Of course, the other question is how much the actual therapy has had to do with these figures. It is well known with drug therapy that there is a large placebo effect with drugs like the SSRIs for depression and anxiety. It is much harder to test that with psychotherapy as it is harder to give a placebo in a properly blinded trial. We also know that many with mental health problems, whether mild or more serious will run a relapsing-remitting course even without therapy. Thus it is possible, though hard to prove either way, that the 53% continued on much as they would have done without any therapy, but a much higher  proportion of the other 47% got a bigger benefit from the therapy itself.

They only had to do half the work we did, if that. Had little resources to learn English and were pretty much pushed through all the grades.

My last act there was testing &amp; validation of the fecal thyroid hormone assay (which we validated in beagles first, actually), which still to this day Sam &amp; I are the only people using I believe. (all these methods including the dogs were also used w North Atlantic right whale since 2001, btw, also involving the Wasser lab). (tangent: this also meant we were out at sea with scenting dogs on 9/11, collecting whale scat, which ended up leading to an accidental study on reduction in boat traffic post-9/11 and a simultaneous decrease in whale stress hormones). 

Been elsewhere since 2004, but 2 yrs ago Sam had to pull out of a symposium at the last second. He had some typical Sam excuse along the lines of ""sorry but Interpol needs me to fly around the world to analyze a freightload of poached ivory from African elephants that they seized in Hong Kong"" (*riiiight Sam, that old excuse again*), or he had to wrestle some ivory poachers or something, I forget. Anyway it was a symposium I was also speaking at, so we arranged for me to give his talk. It was this dataset, not yet quite written up for publication. He talked me through it for 2 hrs on the phone. Solid data, great techniques, but I remember ending up so depressed and worried about the Puget Sound killer whales. I have been distracted since by being depressed &amp; worried about the North Atlantic right whales, but anyway it's good to see this out &amp; getting some press finally.

He &amp; his group have always done spectacular work. His other flagship projects involve African elephant and grizzly bear. Always great work (I'm constantly tempted to relocate back there). I think he is unusual in that he sees through his results to policy change - like, he'll br out in the woods getting the actual data and 2 yrs later (once the paper's out) he's in DC or at the next CITES or IWC meeting or whatever, talking to policymakers to try to push for actual effective change. Not many scientists see it through like that.

It suffice to say that the results of this study is only preliminary and should not be taken as gospel.

I preface this by saying, I'm in support of more research for medical marijuana and the legalization of marijuana in general.  However, it's important to remember publication bias and selection bias.  We hardly ever talk about the studies that show the success of physical therapy in managing neck and lower back pain.  Part of the reason is that, well, in a clinical setting patients will give up due to pain avoidance or simply because it's too much trouble to keep doing it.  More likely, physical therapy is not exciting nor innovative like medical marijuana is.  From my personal experience in a state where medical marijuana was recently legalized, vast majority of our chronic pain patients who have attempted marijuana or medical marijuana will tell you that, no, they make very little impact on their pain.  However, chronic pain management is multifaceted.  For example, some patients accept that they will always have to live with a certain level of pain for the rest of their lives while other patient never do so.  In the latter cases, the use of marijuana to alleviate the anxiety or negate concentration from pain may be why it is helpful in certain patients.  ",1

Our politicians have mostly chosen to focus on issue (5). And even here, they seem to have pinged the wrong player, drug prices. The far bigger culprits are doctors and hospitals (by almost any metric, e.g. they constitute a far greater portion of health care spending, they cost far more in the US than Europe, relative to drug prices in the US and Europe).

Sustainable ideas for reducing healthcare cost that never get any traction:

- rules severely limiting consumption of tobacco and alcohol

- cultural changes that get people more active throughout their lives

- tackling the obesity crisis, especially where it intersects with poverty

Tier two band-aids that wouldn't address underlying issues, but would reduce costs without jeopardizing care:

- change the policies that incentivize people with poor coverage to make the ER their source of primary, not emergent, care

- prevent hospitals from engaging in the nasty behavior of applying extreme markups to drug prices

- implement better pricing transparency (people should have a good idea how much any procedure or medicine will cost them before they get the final bill)

Sex is awesome and great but it has consequences. Mostly emotional and Financial. No one actually cares about people having sex, they care about the consequences of having sex like having kids without Financial backing, disease, social turmoil.

Since the 13th century the Dutch have an extra layer of government which is not seen in other countries: the waterschappen. These entities are responsible for the water control throughout the Netherlands. They are short of independent, for example they raise their own taxes.

These waterschappen are in place to make sure everyone is protected, and not just the local municipalities that happen to have the money the build dams. They make a national plan for all water flows.

"16224",16466," Hi Reddit!

This is TC and Alan, first authors of this paper. Sorry for chipping in so late, a friend alerted us to this post just a moment ago!

We're incredibly honoured by the attention you have showered on this paper; this is our first joint publication, so to see it explode like this is quite the experience! We're happy and grateful to all of you for reading and for sharing your thoughts! 

We'll take this chance to answer some questions:

1\) *Could inequality and polygamy alone have explained the bottleneck?*

We believe that it can't, for the following two reasons: 

\(A\) for the ratio effective population sizes among males and females to have stayed around approximately 1:17 across much of the Old World for approximately 1500 years requires an implausible level of polygamy and hereditary inequality. Extreme polygamy, with more than say 3 wives to a man, or highly transmissible differences in reproductive success due to extreme wealth distributions are characteristic of large\-scale complex societies or ""civilisations""; they are unlikely to be sustained in a small\-scale society that we see just after the Neolithic transition to farming and herding. Such small\-scale societies still exist in Amazonia and in Papua New Guinea, and until recently in India, Africa, some parts of Southwest China and Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. From ethnography, we know that rates of polygamous marriage in small\-scale societies rarely exceed 15&amp;#37;, and usually with at most two wives. 

\(B\) In every part of the Old World, the bottleneck lifts approximately 5000\-4000 years ago. This is precisely the period when chiefdoms and states first emerge, often associated with extreme inequality. Mass human sacrifice, for example, is commonly seen in the first states. However the emergence of chiefdoms and states is associated with the lifting of the bottleneck, not its intensification.

2\) *What is a patrilineal kin group?*

The patrilineal kin group or patriclan is a type of kinship group and a very common mode of social organisation, where men derive their group identity through descent along the male line. Historically, both the Scottish highlanders and especially the Irish were organised into such clans, and one clan among the Irish, the U'Neills, claiming descent from Niall of the nine hostages who may have lived around 350 AD, is associated with a particular Y\-chromosome that is strongly associated with the modern surname O'Neill and rises up to 20&amp;#37; frequency among all men in Northwest Ireland, where this clan was politically dominant since the 4th century AD or so. 

Other peoples organised in this way are the ancient Israelites, early Chinese and the historical Germanic tribes; in the modern world we see this social form among many Arab tribes, Somalis, Maasai, Dinka and Nuer in South Sudan, many societies in Papua New Guinea, and Pashtuns in Afghanistan. In some cases, like in the Arab world, South Sudan and Afghanistan, patrilineal kin groups continue to play some role in politics.

The case of the U'Neills demonstrates that the spread of particular Y chromosomes, which is a change in genes, may be due to cultural, instead of biological factors, thus ""Cultural Hitchhiking"". The other place this seems to be confirmed is for mtDNA among some species of whales, which are \-\-\- you guessed it \-\-\- matrilineal.

3\) *How do patrilineality and competition affect diversity?*

Because patrilineal social organisation sorts males into groups with identical or closely related Y\-chromosomes, wars and feuds between such groups, even if it leads to a low level of group extinction per generation, strongly depresses diversity over 60 generations \(\~1500 years\). Put differently, entire branches of the Y\-chromosomal genetic tree may become extinct when social groups go extinct. Up to twentyfold reductions in diversity are possible with very little or no change in male population size over 60 generations. On the other hand, women tend to marry between kinship groups in patrilineal societies, and so diversity in mtDNA will be spared. These observations are confirmed by our simulation outputs, which can be found in the Supplementary Material. Fig 5 of our paper also shows a series of graphs corresponding to one set of simulations. Our model shows that up to a twenty\-fold reduction Y\-chromosome diversity can be produced without fluctuations in total male population size provided that the population was organised into patrilineal kinship groups that were, so to speak, the relevant ""units of conflict"" at the time.

Our hypothesis regarding the bottleneck also conforms with historical and anthropological data. Before the Neolithic and prior to the bottleneck, i.e. before the spread of farming and herding, all our ancestors were hunter\-gatherers, and hunter\-gatherers tend not to be organised into purely kinship\-based social groups. Most hunter\-gatherer bands contain large fractions of nonkin. With the rise of states and chiefdoms after the bottleneck, large political units integrating many kinship groups also comprise a new form of society, and the defeat of political units, i.e. other states or chiefdoms, was less or not associated with the extinction of kinship groups. So the bottleneck took place after the Neolithic but before the rise of states and chiefdoms, when the ""units of conflict"" among the small scale societies at the time were still kinship\-based small\-scale societies, commonly patrilineal tribes. Therefore, a Y\-chromosome bottleneck at 5k\-7k BP.

So far, our hypothesis is validated by our mathematical and computational models and supported by archaeogenetic findings and anthropological theory. We hope that more discoveries, as well as genetic sequencing of more populations around the world with different histories, can test our hypothesis further.

Unfortunately, my mother developed it too and has dealt with the effects for over 25 years while going through treatments such as enbrel and humera (her current meds) and is now reliant on these meds to function and keep out of a wheelchair. Sadly, I'm afraid I'm starting to see early signs too so I have a lot of interest in the field.

I have several questions:
1. Why are these medicines always so damn expensive? $1,000s per month seems excessive, especially since this family of meds isn't exactly new anymore. What makes them that valuable (outside the greed of the pharmaceutical companies)

2. It seems that almost all medicines in this area are focused on treatment through effectively limiting/lowering the body's immune system to keep the joints from attacking themselves. Is there any other promising research that takes a different approach to this disease that isn't effectively shutting down parts of the body systems to do it? (Oversimplification of how they work, I know)

3. With all the research into DNA and gene therapy, do you foresee any possible ""joint repair"" therapy or anything as a possible treatment in the future?

"15689",15921,"**The Study-** The shape and structure of 4,257 peoples' noses were recorded along with their local temperature/humidity levels. In order to confirm that nose morphology was population/genetically dependent, half of the participants had their genetic ancestry mapped and plotted against nose structure coefficients. For the other half, an estimation of their genetic ancestry was made based on the results of their nose analysis. Statistical analysis proved a relevant correlation.

**The Hypothesis-** As a function of the nose is to ""condition"" the air (clean, regulate temperature and dehumidify) we breath in, these authors thought nose evolution was perhaps forced by climatic factors.

**The Findings-** 1) Nose shape is more differentiated across different countries' populations than expected under genetic drift alone. 2) The width of the nostrils are correlated with temperature and absolute humidity (quantitative measure of water vapor in the air), but not with relative humidity (percentage water vapor content). 3) Other factors, such as sexual selection, are likely also a factor.",0

"17114",17365,"&gt;In order to see how acetaldehyde affects cells when it builds up, the team had to genetically modify mice with a mutation that prevented blood stem cells from producing one of these enzymes, ALDH2.

&gt;""We saw huge amounts of DNA damage in these cells. Bits of DNA were deleted, bits were broken and we even saw parts of chromosomes being moved about and rearranged,"" Patel said.

&gt;The ALDH2-deficient mice had four times the cell damage as control mice with normal ALDH2 production.

&gt;The second defence is a repair system, where the body will get to work trying to fix the damage done to the DNA. But some people have mutations where one or both of these defences don't work.

&gt;For instance, around 540 million people in Asia carry a mutation in the ALDH2 gene, which means they can't process acetaldehyde (one of the factors in the red flush reaction). People with this mutation are at an increased risk of oesophageal cancer, the researchers said.

&gt;Other people have faults in the molecules that conduct the DNA repairs, which means their body will try to use other mechanisms.

&gt;""Our study highlights that not being able to process alcohol effectively can lead to an even higher risk of alcohol-related DNA damage and therefore certain cancers,"" Patel said.

&gt;""But it's important to remember that alcohol clearance and DNA repair systems are not perfect and alcohol can still cause cancer in different ways, even in people whose defence mechanisms are intact.""

tl'dr So once they mutated the mouse to remove the mechanisms that metabolize excess alcohol, it caused DNA damage. So in theory, if you have a mutation that causes this lack of metabolization, you are at risk for DNA damage. 

This will hopefully give doctors something to look for in people who drink, to find out if their body is metabolizing it correctly or not, it will give them an idea on whether alcohol can make them more susceptible to cancer. The amount that one drinks apparently has an increased effect on this as well if they have the mutations. 
So the title is a little misleading, but not too far off. Basically the idea is, if you have the mutation that makes it so you can't metabolize the excess alcohol, and your body is missing the repair mechanism it uses for the DNA repair. You will damage your DNA.",0

Abstract

&gt; Metastatic spread is the mechanism in more than 90 percent of cancer deaths and current therapeutic options, such as systemic chemotherapy, are often ineffective. Here we provide a proof of principle for a novel two-pronged modality referred to as Synergistic Immuno Photothermal Nanotherapy (SYMPHONY) having the potential to safely eradicate both primary tumors and distant metastatic foci. Using a combination of immune-checkpoint inhibition and plasmonic gold nanostar (GNS)-mediated photothermal therapy, we were able to achieve complete eradication of primary treated tumors and distant untreated tumors in some mice implanted with the MB49 bladder cancer cells. Delayed rechallenge with MB49 cancer cells injection in mice that appeared cured by SYMPHONY did not lead to new tumor formation after 60 days observation, indicating that SYMPHONY treatment induced effective long-lasting immunity against MB49 cancer cells.

It will be interesting to see whether this moves on to human clinical trials next.

Any industry that has a lot of domestic labor cost, has as part of its cost the cost of insuring those American workers. *Health care is an industry with a lot of domestic labor cost*. Providing care for all the nurses, doctors, orderlies, candy stripers, receptionists, etc. etc. have to be a large portion of the cost of health care.

Now those workers probably get some of their health care at cost...but not all of it. If they use an expensive machine or pharmaceuticals, those must be purchased from outside the company. Thus many of the drivers of the rising price of health care are going to affect the cost of insuring those workers. Therefore there is probably a positive feedback effect that further increases the cost of health care itself. 

This is why removing insurance companies from the equation could have a gigantic effect on the cost of health care. The costs they add in profit taking, advertising, executive salaries and perks and the enormous administrative costs they impose on providers would be almost completely removed from the system. It's completely unclear what value they add that would be lost as a result. As far as I can tell they are simply leeches on the system.

And as a result of removing those costs, even health care workers would be cheaper to provide care for...further reducing overall cost.

While the sciences mostly involve things that most people are aware of, very few of the concepts, objects and phenomenon that math deals with are known to normal people (compare, for example, the math questions asked on reddit's r/askscience to the science ones). 

This makes it very hard to popularize even the most exciting research happening in the various fields of mathematics (such as Scholze's work in your own field of expertise to take an example). A troubling consequence of all this is that even people who take an active interest in science do not know what mathematicians primarily concern themselves with.^1 

This clearly can't be a healthy state of affairs for the subject and its practitioners. So, my question to you is how can mathematicians honestly go about spreading awareness of what they study instead of the usual 'useful for cryptography, string theory etc.' narrative.

Telomere Length Determines TERRA and R-Loop Regulation through the Cell Cycle.

Abstract:

&gt; Maintenance of a minimal telomere length is essential to prevent cellular senescence. When critically short telomeres arise in the absence of telomerase, they can be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) to prevent premature senescence onset. It is unclear why specifically the shortest telomeres are targeted for HDR. We demonstrate that the non-coding RNA TERRA accumulates as HDR-promoting RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) preferentially at very short telomeres. The increased level of TERRA and R-loops, exclusively at short telomeres, is due to a local defect in RNA degradation by the Rat1 and RNase H2 nucleases, respectively. Consequently, the coordination of TERRA degradation with telomere replication is altered at shortened telomeres. R-loop persistence at short telomeres contributes to activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and promotes recruitment of the Rad51 recombinase.

"17683",17945,"So for anyone wondering: 
There are guidelines as to when to prescribe and what to prescribe. For instance, centor criteria for strep throat, CAP, HCAP, and VAP coverage based on age. Most of the time these things work well, save for the fact that levaquin is still in the recs despite everyone saying please stop prescribing flouroquinolones. 

So, sometimes you prescribe something that should work based on your understanding. For instance, someone comes in with what looks like CAP, they eventually get sent to ICU and they get a little better, but still worried. So you increase coverage and add antifungals. Or you spike a fever in the hospital about 4 days into your stay, you're getting a whole bunch of lab work and empiric antibiotics until I prove its a fluke or non-bacterial. Or cellulitis that should respond to 7days of Abx, but some people need Abx until the cellulitis goes away which sometimes takes 14days...

Also, someone comes in on Saturday and gets Abx before they get culture data (this ruins cultures) now on Monday when hospitalist switch, there is no data to go on so you cut down somewhat if they are looking good, but you generally need to stay broad as the infection may just be viral, but it may also be resistant to a more targeted Abx. 

So we're trying to be good stewards with abx, but sometimes it's difficult.  There are docs that over prescribe, which is what this is showing. Not everyone that comes in needs vanc/Zosyn/Cipro. Sometimes ""just doxy"" or ""just augmentin"" is okay.",0

&gt;Men who consume more pornography are more likely to say they are dissatisfied with the amount of variety in their sex life and the amount of time spent on sex.

&gt;The study, recently published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, investigated the relationship between sexual satisfaction and viewing different types of sexual content.

&gt;""It seems logical that viewing a sports illustrated swimsuit edition is going to influence expectations of sexuality differently than viewing mainstream pornography. It also seems logical that satisfaction with sexual variety is not necessarily the same thing as satisfaction with love and affection in the sexual relationship,"" explained study author Nathan D. Leonhardt of Brigham Young University.

&gt;""Yet, nobody has studied how viewing distinct types of sexual content might differ in influencing different aspects of sexual satisfaction.""

&gt;""In our study, we wanted to start a more comprehensive discussion of how sexual content influences sexual satisfaction,"" Leonhardt told PsyPost. ""We evaluated how both mainstream pornography, with explicit depiction of sexual acts, and non-explicit provocative sexual media, focused on women, were associated with several aspects of sexual satisfaction (time spent on foreplay, variety, overall satisfaction, frequency, love and affection, time spent on intercourse), for both men and women.""

&gt;The study surveyed 858 individuals in committed romantic relationships about their exposure to mainstream heterosexual pornography and other forms of sexually provocative media, such as an image of a woman in her underwear in a provocative pose.

&gt;The researchers found that men who watched more pornography tended to also be more dissatisfied with the amount of variety in their sex life and more dissatisfied with the amount of time spent on intercourse.

&gt;""Pornography use was connected to lower satisfaction with sexual variety and satisfaction with time spent on intercourse, but only for men,"" Leonhardt explained. ""It makes sense that pornography would be more likely to influence satisfaction with sexual variety and time spent on intercourse than viewing provocative sexual media, as pornography actually depicts explicit sexual acts.""

&gt;""Perhaps men who view pornography are disappointed in their partners' lack of ability or desire to perform the sexual acts portrayed in pornography,"" he continued. ""It was interesting that this only held true for men. This is just supposition, but perhaps the negative connection was not there for women because their male partners are more willing to engage in the sexual acts depicted in pornography.""

&gt;However, more frequent pornography use was not associated with lower overall sexual satisfaction for men or women.

&gt;When it came to non-explicit provocative media of women, Leonhardt and his colleague found some evidence that it was associated with problems among the female participants.

&gt;""For both men and women, use of provocative sexual media was negatively connected to satisfaction with love and affection in the sexual relationship; we suspect this is due to the objectifying nature of the content. It could be difficult to establish a sexual relationship built on love and affection if individuals accept a message of sexuality without identity,"" Leonhardt explained.

&gt;""Interestingly, provocative sexual media was particularly problematic for women, as it was also connected to lower satisfaction with sexual variety, overall sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with time spent on intercourse. We suspect that women's provocative sexual media use could be leading to a greater likelihood of self-objectification, which could negatively influence sexuality in a variety of ways.""

&gt;""Overall, our study highlighted the complexity of the connection between viewing sexual content and sexual satisfaction, but provided insight into the nuances by clarifying which aspects of sexual satisfaction are connected to viewing specific types of sexual content,"" Leonhardt told PsyPost.

&gt;The study used a cross-sectional design, meaning the researchers cannot draw conclusions about cause and effect.

&gt;""The first major caveat is that we cannot claim causality,"" Leonhardt said. ""We cannot be sure which variables are actually influencing the others. Take the negative connection between men's use of pornography and satisfaction with sexual variety as an example. The association may be due to men being disappointed in being unable to participate in sexual acts depicted in pornography.""

&gt;""Yet another equally plausible explanation is that men who are dissatisfied with the variety in their sexual relationship are looking at pornography in an attempt to find new ideas for sexual practices.""


&gt;The research still leaves some questions unanswered.

&gt;""Another major caveat is that our data did not consist of both partners' perspectives,"" Leonhardt said. ""It would be helpful to see how these results might differ based on evaluating both partners' moral approval of viewing sexual content, and the extent to which couples are viewing the content together.""

&gt;""We hope our study opens the door to exploring additional nuances in how the type of sexual content viewed influences differing types of sexual satisfaction,"" he added. ""On a practical note, those who view sexual content should carefully consider the messages presented, and whether those messages align with what they ultimately are pursuing in a sexual relationship.""

**Abstract:**

A growing body of evidence suggests that criminal activities associated with drug trafficking networks are a progressively important driver of forest loss in Central America. However, the scale at which drug trafficking represents a driver of forest loss is not presently known. We estimated the degree to which narcotics trafficking may contribute to forest loss using an unsupervised spatial clustering of 15 spatial and temporal forest loss patch metrics developed from global forest change data. We distinguished anomalous forest loss from background loss patches for each country exhibiting potential 'narco-capitalized' signatures which showed a statistically significant dissimilarity from other patches in terms of size, timing, and rate of forest loss. We also compared annual anomalous forest loss with the number of cocaine shipments and volume of cocaine seized, lost, or delivered at country- and department-level. For Honduras, results from linear mixed effects models showed a highly significant relationship between anomalous forest loss and the timing of increased drug trafficking (F = 9.90, p = 0.009) that also differed significantly from temporal patterns of background forest loss (t-ratio = 2.98, p = 0.004). Other locations of high forest loss in Central America showed mixed results. The timing of increased trafficking was not significantly related to anomalous forest loss in Guatemala and Nicaragua, but significantly differed in patch size compared to background losses. We estimated that cocaine trafficking could account for between 15% and 30% of annual national forest loss in these three countries over the past decade, and 30% to 60% of loss occurred within nationally and internationally designated protected areas. Cocaine trafficking is likely to have severe and lasting consequences in terms of maintaining moist tropical forest cover in Central America. Addressing forest loss in these and other tropical locations will require a stronger linkage between national and international drug interdiction and conservation policies.

"10926",11079,"Drug prices can't be materially higher in the US .vs. other nations without illegal price restraints, some of which have been made ""law"" by Congress over the years.   Why?  Because without said laws a lot of people would simply hop on a plane, fill a suitcase with the drug in another nation and get back on board for the return trip, selling the drug here. 

This very thing happens with processors, TVs, cellphones and similar -- but without the need for people to get on the plane, because businesses do this immediately to take advantage of the arbitrage.  That in turn collapses the arbitrage almost immediately to mere pennies.

15 USC Chapter 1 says that preventing that by restraining trade or forming monopolies is illegal.  So the drug companies went to Congress and through the FDA and various other acts in both law and the CFRs got laws and regulations passed so if you attempt this you will go to prison.

The same is true for ""administrative complexity.""  Why would not some physician or hospital eschew that, take only cash, sell directly and undercut everyone else by at least 50%?

The only means to stop this is through either laws passed (e.g. CON laws, etc) or to break the law by restraining trade and forming monopolies -- for example, by hospitals buying up physician practices to effectively eliminate competition.

All of this is a felony under 100+ year old law.

But it's very profitable for everyone involved though and produces ""jobs"" -- roughly 300,000 of them a year -- as I have been pointing out for quite some time.  If you start arresting people for breaking the law and thus make clear that restraining trade, forming monopolies and price-fixing will result in incarceration then the immediate effect will be that people will come into the market without those inefficiencies (since they cannot be stomped on by the industry, backed up by the guns of the federal government) and 3/4 or more of those people who were hired, who I remind you would over the last decade be about 3 million jobs will disappear overnight.

They won't stay gone for long, nor will the GDP impact (which would be about 15%, incidentally) as the result would also be a monstrous decrease in the cost of doing business in the United States, and quickly lead to a huge economic boom in response.  In fact I expect the adjustment and resulting economic boom would take somewhere around 6-12 months to occur, and the permanent and positive economic impacts would be clear within a year.

But, in the interim there would be an extremely severe recession with concurrent job loss, those in the industry and their lobbyists would blame the politicians for throwing Granny down the stairs, the ""feels"" people would get all up in arms and wave signs and some politicians would lose their jobs.

"17246",17500,"Unless the dementia they have is have behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, sadly. Alzheimers Disease spreads in nodes of the Default Mode Network, which works antagonistically with the Salience Network- they have inhibitory effects on one another, and decreased activity in one network is associated with increased activity in the other. So as AD causes degeneration in the DMN, you can see relative sparing and even increased activation of the Salience Network. This is why patients with AD retain their personality and interpersonal warmth for so long in comparison to other cognitive functions such as memory and attention. 

BvFTD is in many ways the ""opposite"" of AD. It causes atrophy in the nodes of the Salience Network, which is associated with social and emotional processing, while sparing the DMN, which supports the formation of new memories and any cognitive task that involves picturing the self in the past/future, among other things. So people diagnosed with this dementia have no initial memory symptoms, but exhibit striking behavioral changes, a loss of empathy, and broad social-emotional processing deficits. Because of this, they are often misdiagnosed with psychiatric disorders before the progression of symptoms and imaging apparent atrophy allows for an accurate diagnosis.  

It's a horrific disease like all dementias, but relatively lesser known with comparison to AD, despite being the second most common form of early-onset dementia. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19376066) is the famous paper providing imaging evidence for the network degeneration hypothesis, and [here](https://www.theaftd.org/what-is-ftd/ftd-disorders/behavioral-variant-ftd-bvftd/) is a website with more information about frontotemporal dementia.

"13608",13803,"It stands to reason that parents who physically or emotionally abuse their children do them lasting damage, among other things by undermining their ability to trust others and accurately read their emotions.

But what about the children of parents who experience simple, everyday conflict?

New research published in the current issue of the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships shows that the emotional processing of these children, too, can be affected - potentially making them over-vigilant, anxious and vulnerable to distorting human interactions that are neutral in tone, throwing them off-balance interpersonally as adults.

""The message is clear: even low-level adversity like parental conflict isn't good for kids,"" said Alice Schermerhorn, an assistant professor in the University of Vermont's Department of Psychological Sciences and the lead author of the study.

In the study, 99 nine-to-eleven-year-olds were divided into two groups based on a series of psychological assessments they took that scored how much parental conflict they experienced and how much they felt the conflict threatened their parents' marriage.

Children were then shown a series of photographs of couples engaged in happy, angry or neutral interactions and asked to choose which category the photos fit.

Children from the low conflict homes consistently scored the photos accurately. Those from high conflict homes who experienced the conflict as a threat were able to accurately identify the happy and angry couples, but not those in neutral poses - incorrectly reading them as either angry or happy or saying they didn't know which category they fit.

Schermerhorn sees two possible interpretations of the results.

The inaccuracy may attributable to hypervigilance.

""If their perception of conflict and threat leads children to be vigilant for signs of trouble, that could lead them to interpret neutral expressions as angry ones or may simply present greater processing challenges,"" she said.

Alternatively, it could be that neutral parental interactions may be less significant for children who feel threatened by their parents' conflict.

""They may be more tuned into angry interactions, which could be a cue for them to retreat to their room, or happy ones, which could signal that their parents are available to them,"" she said. ""Neutral interactions don't offer much information, so they may not value them or learn to recognize them.""

Shyness Compounds Problem

The study is also one of the first to measure the impact of temperamental shyness on the children's ability to process and recognize emotion.

The shy children in the study, who were identified via a questionnaire given to the mothers of the study subjects, were unable to correctly identify couples in neutral poses, even if they were not from high conflict homes.

Shyness also made them more vulnerable to parental conflict. Children who were both shy and felt threated by their parents' conflict had a high level of inaccuracy in identifying neutral interactions.

""Parents of shy children need to be especially thoughtful about how they express conflict,"" Schermerhorn said.

Implications for adulthood

The research results are significant, Schermerhorn said, for the light they shed on the impact relatively low-level adversity like parental conflict can have on children's development.

Either of her interpretations of the research findings could spell trouble for children down the road.

""One the one hand, being over-vigilant and anxious can be destabilizing in many different ways,"" she said.

""On the other, correctly reading neutral interactions may not be important for children who live in high conflict homes, but that gap in their perceptual inventory could be damaging in subsequent experiences with, for example, teachers, peers, and partners in romantic relationships.""

""No one can eliminate conflict altogether,"" she said, ""but helping children get the message that, even when they argue, parents care about each other and can work things out is important.""

My theory:

Look at who *mostly* plays video games.  Males.  Now look at what those games are about.  War, combat, sports, competition.  Now look at a modern male's actual life.  Mundane, mediocre job.  No excitement, no thrill, no need to use any survival instincts.  Our brains are ROTTING from the rut of an existence we have created in our modern society.

The solution is video games.  It's the only reasonable way for a modern person of average income to get any feeling of joy or contentment.  It's an escape from reality, but look at where we escape to.  War, combat, competition, sports.  It's what our *souls need*, yet there's no feasible way to obtain it through our daily working lives.  The only solution is an apocalypse.

I remember seeing a show about dogs once, where it said certain dogs have their purpose, their ""job"" embedded in their DNA.  They don't have to worry about their purpose in life, they already know it and they automatically excel in it.  *BUT*, if you take that dog and put him in a cooped up apartment, he will develop mental issues like depression or act melancholy, OCD habits such as chasing lights, barking at things, etc.  It's because he is being kept from fulfilling his purpose in life.

Now look at the modern American.  Depression, OCD, anxiety, etc.  An epidemic.  It's because our real purpose has been made obsolete.  We no longer fight for survival, we drone on to entertain ourselves.  It's destroying us.  Video games are a temporary relief from it.    ",1

1) Do you have any idea whether the resistance allele formation is due to changes in the gene being targeted for CRISPR editing (such as mutations in the target sequence)? Or is it due to failure of the CRISPR itself (mutations within the CRISPR construct, or possibly epigenetic modifications to shut off the CRISPR construct?

2) With such a variation in strains you have tested this system in, have you thought about using a genetic reference panel to identify the genes that may contribute to resistance allele formation? This could be done fairly efficiently with the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to identify the specific genes influence the resistance allele formation.

&gt; DOES DIM LIGHT MAKE US DUMBER?

&gt; Spending too much time in dimly lit rooms and offices may actually change the brain's structure and hurt one's ability to remember and learn, indicates groundbreaking research by Michigan State University neuroscientists.

&gt; The researchers studied the brains of Nile grass rats (which, like humans, are diurnal and sleep at night) after exposing them to dim and bright light for four weeks. The rodents exposed to dim light lost about 30 percent of capacity in the hippocampus, a critical brain region for learning and memory, and performed poorly on a spatial task they had trained on previously.

Abstract

&gt; The effects of light on cognitive function have been well-documented in human studies, with brighter illumination improving cognitive performance in school children, healthy adults, and patients in early stages of dementia. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. The present study examined how ambient light affects hippocampal function using the diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) as the animal model. Grass rats were housed in either a 12:12 h bright light-dark (brLD, 1,000 lux) or dim light-dark (dimLD, 50 lux) cycle. After 4 weeks, the dimLD group showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. The impairment in their MWM performance were reversed when the dimLD group were transferred to the brLD condition for another 4 weeks. The results suggest that lighting conditions influence cognitive function of grass rats in a way similar to that observed in humans, such that bright light is beneficial over dim light for cognitive performance. In addition to the behavioral changes, grass rats in the dimLD condition exhibited reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, most notably in the CA1 subregion. There was also a reduction in dendritic spine density in CA1 apical dendrites in dimLD as compared to the brLD group, and the reduction was mostly in the number of mushroom and stubby spines. When dimLD animals were transferred to the brLD condition for 4 weeks, the hippocampal BDNF and dendritic spine density significantly increased. The results illustrate that not only does light intensity affect cognitive performance, but that it also impacts hippocampal structural plasticity. These studies serve as a starting point to further understand how ambient light modulates neuronal and cognitive functions in diurnal species. A mechanistic understanding of the effects of light on cognition can help to identify risk factors for cognitive decline and contribute to the development of more effective prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment in clinical populations.",0

Abstract:

&gt; OBJECTIVE: To analyze recent trends in maternal mortality by sociodemographic characteristics and cause of death and to evaluate data quality.

&gt; METHODS: This observational study compared data from 2008-2009 with 2013-2014 for 27 states and the District of Columbia that had comparable reporting of maternal mortality throughout the period. Maternal mortality rates were computed per 100,000 live births. Statistical significance of trends and differentials was evaluated using a two-proportion z-test.

&gt; RESULTS: The study population included 1,687 maternal deaths and 7,369,966 live births. The maternal mortality rate increased by 23% from 20.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2008-2009 to 25.4 in 2013-2014. However, most of the increase was among women aged 40 years or older and for nonspecific causes of death. From 2008-2009 to 2013-2014, maternal mortality rates increased by 90% for women 40 years of age or older but did not increase significantly for women younger than 40 years. The maternal mortality rate for nonspecific causes of death increased by 48%; however, the rate for specific causes of death did not increase significantly between 2008-2009 (13.5) and 2013-2014 (15.0).

&gt; CONCLUSION: Despite the United Nations Millennium Development Goal and a 44% decline in maternal mortality worldwide from 1990 to 2015, maternal mortality has not improved in the United States and appears to be increasing. Maternal mortality rates for women 40 years or older and for nonspecific causes of death were implausibly high and increased rapidly, suggesting possible overreporting of maternal deaths, which may be increasing over time. Efforts to improve reporting for the pregnancy checkbox and to modify coding procedures to place less reliance on the checkbox are essential to improving vital statistics maternal mortality data, the official data source for maternal mortality statistics used to monitor trends, identify at-risk populations, and evaluate the success of prevention efforts.",0

This is such a fundamental process, that it makes sense that screwing it up has negative effects. I do appreciate how they showed synaptic effects in the hippocampus. However, much is to be desired on the mechanistic side. 

My biggest issue is the flavor of this sort of science. I can't find any reference to a single failure in the paper (someone correct me if I'm wrong). The authors chose a gene from a screen and it did exactly what they hoped it would. I really would believe their work more if they had tried knocking out other genes and no link was found. Good papers not only provide evidence for their hypothesis, but they also demonstrate why other hypotheses are less reasonable. Or at least, a good paper should have some negative data.

All these help, but not the way opiates/opioids do.

I'm suspicious of the changes being made to the current medical infrastructure. I'm suspicious because I'm the prototype of a person ridiculed because they desire opiates for what is viewed as a ""nonsense"" disorder. People by and large view RLS as a disease invented by a pharmaceutical company with a bloated PR office. These days, people tend to view opiates as only appropriate for broken bones, surgical recoveries, and similarly dire situations.

&gt;The majority of the world's terrestrial large carnivores have undergone substantial range contractions and many of these species are currently threatened with extinction. However, there has been little effort to fully quantify the extent of large carnivore range contractions, which hinders our ability to understand the roles and relative drivers of such trends. Here we present and analyse a newly constructed and comprehensive set of large carnivore range contraction maps. We reveal the extent to which ranges have contracted since historical times and identify regions and biomes where range contractions have been particularly large. In summary, large carnivores that have experienced the greatest range contractions include the red wolf (Canis rufus) (greater than 99%), Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) (99%), tiger (Panthera tigris) (95%) and lion (Panthera leo) (94%). In general, the greatest range contractions occurred in Southeastern Asia and Africa. Motivated by the ecological importance of intact large carnivore guilds, we also examined the spatial extent of intact large carnivore guilds both for the entire world and regionally. We found that intact carnivore guilds occupy just 34% of the world's land area. This compares to 96% in historic times. Spatial modelling of range contractions showed that contractions were significantly more likely in regions with high rural human population density, cattle density or cropland. Our results offer new insights into how best to prevent further range contractions for the world's largest carnivores, which will assist efforts to conserve these species and their important ecological effects.",0

I did a fair amount of research on this issue back in 2005. One of the best basic resources for information about road salt is this nearly 20 year old [fact sheet from EPA](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P1000ZRC.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1995%20Thru%201999&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C95THRU99%5CTXT%5C00000021%5CP1000ZRC.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r105g16/r105g16/x150y150g16/i600&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1). It's old, but it might as well have been written yesterday. 

Besides EPA, the federal highway administration also cares a LOT about salt, because it corrodes roads and bridges. And there are also lots of other people who care deeply about road salt. There are private consultants who can train you on how to use salt appropriately. There are public works groups dedicated to ""snowfighting."" There's even a salt lobby, fighting to make sure we keep putting the stuff down. The net result is that there is a huge amount of info on the topic. 

The most important thing to know is that there's no good solution to winter driving. Salt has major consequences, and they're well known. Sand (and gravel, cinders, and other ""abrasives""), regardless of what you think you know, doesn't work most of the time. Beet juice, molasses, etc., all have positives and negatives. Other salts, like MgCl and CaCl, are somewhat better in some regards but much worse in others. 

The best we can do for now is to be intelligent about our use of salt and use a lot less than we currently do. Unfortunately, that just delays the problems, but it also buys us some time. Also unfortunately, almost no one wants to spend the money or time to become intelligent about using salt. Much easier and cheaper just to keep dumping massive quantities of it, and the guys who do the actual work tend not to be all that into best management practices.

&gt; One important psychological mechanism of advertising is mere exposure inducing positive attitudes towards brands. Recent basic research has shown that the underlying mechanism of mere exposure for words, in turn, is the training of subvocal pronunciation, which can be obstructed by oral motor-interference. Commercials for foreign brands were shown in cinema sessions while participants either ate popcorn, chewed gum (oral interference) or consumed a single sugar cube (control). Brand choice and brand attitudes were assessed one week later. While control participants more likely spent money (Experiment 1, N = 188) and exhibited higher preference and physiological responses (Experiment 2, N = 96) for advertised than for novel brands, participants who had consumed popcorn or gum during commercials showed no advertising effects. It is concluded that advertising might be futile under ecological situations involving oral interference, such as snacking or talking, which ironically is often the case.

Anecdotal story: When I was a child, my doctor, who graduated medical school in 1922 (yes, 1922), was presented a case. This chap had been vomiting, had headaches and a general feeling of malaise. He saw a dozen or so doctors and specialists, and after many tests they could find nothing wrong. After visiting with my GP, he simply asked a few questions that went something like this ... ""what do you do for a living"". The answer, ""I'm an elevator operator"". ""So you spend most of your time on your feet while working?"". The answer, ""yes"". ""Take off your shoes"". To which the man took off his shoes, and the the doctor noticed slightly discolored feet. ""You don't wear any socks?"". The answer, ""no I don't"". ""Well, you should start wearing socks, and you'll be fine"". 

As it turned out, the man was suffering from a case of poisoning from his leather shoes leaching chemicals into his feet.

The taxhike is done by taxing graduate students who get their tuition as gift from the university.

Universities get around paying higher wages by basically deducting the tuition fee from the wage, but not calling it that. They just ""forgive"" the tuition fee, thus allowing them to pay lower wages, because students don't have to require wages to pay that tuition out of.

For the system that means basically the tuition gets removed from the system twice. As part of the wage, and as part of the revenue of the universities.

**The outrage**: Taxing things that you DIDN'T pay. If that logic was broadly applied, homeless people would have to pay taxes for meals received at the soup kitchen. If you get anything for free as promotion, or gift. that would all have to be declared as income. Which is on one level ludicrous. (even more absurdly: Technically if you get a tax deduction, it would have to be counted as taxable income, which is the outcome of taxing things you DIDN'T earn.....). It creates a giant question mark in terms of ""perks of a job"". What kind of benefits to you by having a certain job should be quantified and taxed? How about a company car? Do you have to declare that? Do you apply ""common leasing rates""?

**The justification**: You can't just remove ANY gift from taxation, because it allows for massive tax evasion. There is a difference for the system whether you get peanuts as wages but board and food as ""gift"", or getting a proper wage that gets taxed and have to PAY for accommodation and for your food (each being taxed as income for the provider)

In this case the universities basically are skirting their dues by artificially reducing their revenue (tuition fees not taken in) but compensating it with lower wages, thus reducing the payroll tax on the students side.

**The flaw**:
THe flaw is that this AGAIN is  putting the pressure on the weakest people IN this situation, by now taxing the forgiven tuition as income, as IF they had received it as income and then paid it, thus making receiving the waiver unattractive, thus forcing the students to demand wages that allows them to PAY the tuition, which then gets taxed as revenue on the universities side.  
edit: Additional flaw: It doesn't work. The workaround for the university is to increase the wages by JUST the amount the students have to pay as taxes, this STILL doesn't force them to pay taxes on their forgiven revenue (basically implying that universities are lobbying hard enough to skirt THAT part of the problem)

**Solution**: If the goal is to prevent universities to apply this trick, but not want to punish the students, the tuition would have to be tax deductible. Basically the whole problem only arises because of for-profit education to begin with.

**Additional observation**:
The above is independent from observations or disagreement of how the actual tax burden is distributed in the US. It doesn't address how the worst offenders against the common good get the most lenient tax deductions and lowest taxes, or why specifically for profit education is under the microscope here, rather than other ways to avoid contributing to society.

"17594",17856,"I have two related questions that bother me about the foundation of transgenderism. I know many will think these read like ""trolling"" but they are absolutely sincere. Also, I'm going to refer to some social gender constructs that will seem somewhat... ""narrow minded"" - I want to be clear I am ***NOT*** expressing my own opinions about ""what is normal"" but rather referring to the existing social constructs in the Western world. 

1) How do you define ""gender identity"" in a way that doesn't reflect social norms of gender behavior? As I understand it, the standard trappings of ""gender"" are mostly social constructs. In the US, it's ""wearing dresses,"" ""playing with dolls,"" makeup, etc - all the usual suspects in gender stereotyping. 

Within this social framework, someone born XY can cross-dress, play with dolls, love romance novels, and be homosexual yet they're not TG. Can an XY prefer jeans, carpentry, watching football, and love women yet be TG? 

(again - PLEASE note that I am talking in terms of what large swaths of US society consider ""normal"" for men and women, not my own beliefs)

2) Building on that - if someone feels the need to have their right leg amputated because it ""feels wrong"" we treat them for body dysmorphic disorder. As far as I know it's unethical to go ahead and remove the leg. 

But if an XY wants their ""plumbing reworked"" to have indoor plumbing instead of an outhouse, then they have gender dysphoria. They will get counseling and support, but eventually may be able to get surgery to realize their inner feelings. 

How are these two situations differentiated clinically?

This is a useful study that documented turnover associated with successional changes in forests, and also found significant declines in some individual species, but the headline number about declines in *all* birds is almost certainly an artifact of shifting methodologies or surveyor sets after the first two years of the program.

My dog is allowed to sleep in my bed once a week.  I hate having him in bed with me, mostly because when he's with me I often wake up with a tweak in my back.  I think it's because he limits my ability to toss and turn and readjust to my comfort level during the night, so I pretty much stay in the same position.

However, the two easiest ways to create a bond with your dog are 1.  Feeding my hand, and 2. Sleeping in the same bed and creating the puppy pile.  

It's not insignificant.  You can feel the dog's bond to you as soon as you wake up - mine looks to me more often and has his attention more atttuned to me, and is generally more obedient the day after he sleeps with me.

So it's a trade off. But yeah, when I need a good night's sleep he does NOT get to sleep with me.

Are people who more or less just cruised controlled through high school and don't know how to cope with actual demanding courses. This might result in a former A-B student dipping in grades, attempting to learn better or work harder, or simply resorting to cheating to help bridge the gap because they might feel overwhelmed.

Abstract

When pursuing goals, consumers often face setbacks that force them to reevaluate their goals. Yet, current goal theory offers limited explanations for how people respond to recurring challenges and disengage from their goals. Through five experiments investigating three primary theoretical aims, this research extends the field's understanding of action crisis, a possible goal pursuit stage marked by internal conflict over whether or not to continue, and investigates it in consumption contexts such as patient-physician relationships, weight loss diets, and environmentally friendly purchasing. Experiments 1A-1C show that consumer action crisis encourages more disengagement-related and less continuation-supportive cost-benefit thinking than nonproblematic action phase. Experiment 2 replicates this cognitive shift, and connects action crisis to diminished goal-related evaluations and weakened commitment. Experiment 3 further clarifies action crisis' influence on consumer goal pursuit by revealing decreased cognitive and behavioral engagement that does not involve a shift in construal level when compared to action phase consumers. Extending understanding of action crisis as a possible mindset and action phase, these five experiments advance goal disengagement theory by connecting changes in cognition, motivation, and behavior to action crisis.

First of all, it turns out that their study dates back to at least [2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22341001M). So for some reason they haven't published (or haven't been able to publish) their results for 4 years. And back in 2014, they claimed that they found an orbital time of ~800 Myr, whereas now they claim it's closer to 1 Gyr. That already gives an indication how (un)reliable their conclusions are.

And that's no surprise, because there are a lot of uncertainties involved. It's difficult to get reliable estimates of galactic orbital velocities, and there's a lot of fuzziness (i.e. wiggle room) regarding the outer edge of a disk galaxy. On top of that, there's the question of how much the results depend on the data sample that's used (and whether the authors have selected data that fits their narrative).

Abstract

&gt; This study identifies and analyzes statistically significant overlaps between selective sweep screens in anatomically modern humans and several domesticated species. The results obtained suggest that (paleo-)genomic data can be exploited to complement the fossil record and support the idea of self-domestication in Homo sapiens, a process that likely intensified as our species populated its niche. Our analysis lends support to attempts to capture the ""domestication syndrome"" in terms of alterations to certain signaling pathways and cell lineages, such as the neural crest.

"27170",28706,"As a Norwegian who has lived in the US, I am not surprised at all that the US has this problem. The US has left everything to do with food over to the free market. There seems to be little to no concern about society's need to safeguard the health and prosperity of its children. Fast food companies are allowed to run rampant. Fast food ads everywhere, even in school books. Soda dispensers at schools. Even school lunches are frequently junk food.

In Norway pre-schools don't allow soda or other sugary drinks for the kids. There are no cakes or cookies for birthdays. If you put junk food in your kids lunch box they have a talk with you. Mind you this is not top-down but rather parents sit together with the pre-school to agree on common rules. Most parents like that there are rules like this and support it, because it is very hard to keep your own kids lunch box healthy if other kids bring chocolate, cookies or soda. A pre-school kids get to participate in making food from the ground up, cutting vegtables etc.

When they start school, first thing we get is a cook-book showing how to make healthy food for kids. The government also sponsors courses for parents on how to feed kids health food and get them to eat healthy.

But the policy to promote healthy living exists at all levels. In Norway we chose to have more but smaller schools relative to population compared to North America so that schools can more often be in walk-able distance for children. We try to organize neighborhoods so that there are foot paths going to schools which are safe for kids.

There are laws and regulations at many levels to promote health eating. Like healthy foods are labeled with a special marking in the super market. Baby foods can't have added sugar or salt. This is stuff I took for granted but which I see is not the case in the US. I tried to get baby food without salt and sugar added and almost gave up when in the US.

This is what I see as the issue in the US. It seems to be all hands off. How do you think kids are going to get slimmer and healthier if there are no policies to promote healthier living? Everything in society seems to promote a car oriented, consume as much as possible culture. If somebody gets fat, people are eager to fat-shame them and deem them weak. It is as if nobody sees a role for society to promote healthy living. Instead it is all up to every individual to make health choices in the midst of a blitzkrieg from junk food companies telling them to do the opposite.

Examples are innumerous, yet we are expected to clock in and out, drive the cars that poison the planet, eat the food that poisons our bodies &amp; planets and frankly submit to a culture that is in a thanatos moment which most people refuse to acknowledge-it is literally an economic and existential crisis of mass proportions.

"5616",5687,"&gt; Psilocybin can occasion enduring trait-level increases in prosocial attitudes/behaviors and in healthy psychological functioning.

Roland Griffiths, the first listed author, said:

&gt; ""What is unique about this latest study is that positive changes were found in several traits. In contrast to 'states', 'traits' are relatively stable and very resistant to change,"" explained Griffiths. ""Importantly, the trait changes were measured using scientifically validated scales, and positive change was corroborated by ratings from friends and colleagues who had established relationships with study participants,"" he added.

Pro-social behavior includes things like altruism.

&gt; Prosocial behavior, or ""voluntary behavior intended to benefit another"",[1] is a social behavior that ""benefit[s] other people or society as a whole"",[2] ""such as helping, sharing, donating, co-operating, and volunteering"".

Altruism in particular had a 'very large' increase, comparing the groups where the only difference was using a placebo amount of psilocybin vs the large psilocybin dose group. 

If you're a large funder interested in this work, I suggest sending an email to Roland Griffiths or Dave Nichols from [Heffter](http://heffter.org/) - both of their email addresses are accessible online.

&gt; Altruism: Comparing LD-SS to HD-SS, the effect size was 1.36, which statisticians consider ""very large."" Comparing LD-SS to HD-HS, the effect size was 1.95, considered ""very large,"" almost ""huge.""

Regarding safety and before considering doing this yourself:

&gt; ""Safety with psilocybin encompasses more than its direct pharmacological effects. We know that psilocybin is remarkably non-toxic to the body's organ systems. But there are behavioral risks: if someone experiences high anxiety, fear, or paranoia during a psilocybin session, it's not hard to imagine them behaving in ways harmful to themselves or others,"" explained Matthew W. Johnson, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins and lead author of an earlier Hopkins paper on hallucinogen administration safety. Johnson, also an author of the new study, continued, ""We can also imagine the possibility that strong, transient negative emotions could leave someone feeling confused and psychologically overwhelmed without appropriate interpersonal support. Both of these risks appear to be minimized when volunteers develop a trusting relationship with a skilled monitor, who remains present with them for the duration of the substance's primary effects, and who is available afterwards for consultation.""The researchers said they do not recommend use of psilocybin outside of such a controlled setting.

I'm curious what advice you have for STEM grad students that also serve as teaching assistants. During my first week, I'd assumed that the students -- just as I did -- cared about the structure and (let's just say it) legibility of their written work. I was wrong. The issue, however, is that the students were resistant to and vocally complained about being taught how to structure their arguments and how to write clearly and concisely. (Can still hear their favourite complaint *BUT WE'RE NOT IN ENGLISH CLASS!!*.) Systematic problems aside, what should STEM teaching assistants do to reinforce how important it is to have a solid grasp on the English language, especially when first- and second-year students all seem so hostile towards it?",0

There have been times where I knowingly ate gluten (like a few years ago in France I just had to eat a pan au chocolat because I used to be obsessed about them), and I could not discern any clear symptoms. Other times, it's been quite clear, and even extended over a week.

Things like nervous system damage, damage to my bones, malnourishment... they're pretty serious things that can affect my quality of life severely in my later years.

I really hope there will be better tools to avoid gluten in food, or medicines to treat celiac disease. It's just not possible for me to perfectly avoid gluten when I can't know if I've consumed it. Like what are the cross-contamination levels at the different restaurants I go to?

Whereas the past several months, my workplace has taken to overloading the queues and reducing staff to perform back-office work to where the things I would normally supposed to complete every week are being completed once every two to three weeks at best, in favor of moving people tasked to inbound phone calls, which in and of themselves *never* stop, and they even opt to pull people onto them every day for periods where they're getting tons of calls outside their apparent expectations. As someone who is reserved for back-office work regardless of phone volumes, which is such a rare position to begin with (think 2 people in over 80 or so in my branch), I find myself far more stressed and prone to wanting to just desteam by browsing a couple Reddit posts on my phone reach hour than I ever did when I was allotted enough resources and backup to just feel like I'd finished my work properly and in a timely manner.

&gt; HAVING CHILDREN MAKES WOMEN'S DNA LOOK 11 YEARS OLDER THAN IT SHOULD


&gt; As any mother will tell you, having kids does a lot to a person's body-and new research suggests it may even change a woman on a cellular level. Sections of genetic material associated with lifespan called telomeres are shorter in women who have given birth, according to a paper published February 14 in Human Reproduction. Specifically, the telomeres of women who have had children are as short as if they were childless and 11 years older.

Abstract

&gt; STUDY QUESTION

&gt; Is telomere length related to parity among a nationally representative sample of US reproductive age women?

&gt; SUMMARY ANSWER

&gt; History of live birth was associated with shorter telomere length.

&gt; WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY

&gt; Shorter telomeres have been linked with a range of chronic health conditions and mortality and parity has been associated with health indicators. However, there is a lack of research on how parity relates to telomere length.

&gt; STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION

&gt; This nationally representative, cross-sectional study included 1954 women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002, the only survey period which includes measurement of telomere length.

&gt; PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS

&gt; Women aged 20-44 were included. Parity, defined as number of previous live births, was ascertained by questionnaire. Leukocyte telomere length was measured by polymerase chain reaction and reported as a ratio in relation to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). The relationship between leukocyte T/S ratio and parity was examined using survey weighted linear regression. Models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, BMI, income-to-poverty ratio, education, early age at menarche and smoking status.

&gt; MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE

&gt; Among reproductive age women in the US, the adjusted mean leukocyte T/S ratio was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.9, 7.3) shorter in parous compared with nulliparous women. Parity was associated with 116 fewer base pairs (95% CI: 26, 204) on average, using estimated coefficients from the adjusted linear regression models and mean covariate values.

&gt; LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION

&gt; This study was cross-sectional and therefore was unable to establish temporality. The dataset lacked information on social factors, stress and fertility status, which may help explain these findings. Only two previous studies have examined this question and our findings should be interpreted with caution.

&gt; WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS

&gt; These findings in a nationally representative sample of US reproductive age women suggest that history of live birth may be associated with accelerated cellular aging. The magnitude of the observed association was greater than that of the impact of smoking or obesity on telomere length, suggesting that parity may have an independent influence on cellular aging and warrant further study.",0

For those who are curious but too lazy to read, general intelligence was measured by analyzing the relationship between 10 separate, empirically-validated cognitive tests. Factor analysis was used to identify an underlying *g* factor (general intelligence) partially responsible for the correlations between scores on different tests. 

Brief version of the intelligence results:
&gt;There were statistically significant sex differences on nine of the ten cognitive subtests, with the exception of processing speed (Table 5). Females scored higher on the episodic and verbal episodic memory tests, and males scored higher on the [progressive matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices), vocabulary, reading, working memory, spatial orientation, and the [Flanker task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eriksen_flanker_task).

The generally higher performance by men was mostly attributable to general intelligence (*g*). After controlling for this factor,
&gt;males still scored significantly higher on spatial processing and the Flanker task. Females still scored significantly higher on the two episodic memory tasks. The other tasks did no longer show significant sex differences beyond those that can be attributed to *g*.

Finally, the difference in *g* corresponds to a difference of about 3-4 IQ points. You may judge the practical significance of that yourself.",0

For light of exactly the ideal wavelength, the material can use about 2% of the light to split CO2. That is worse than plants (~3-5%) and algae (up to ~10%). If you use sunlight, most of the light does not have the right wavelength, which means the material is probably worse by a factor 100 or more.

If you want to use artificial light, it only gets worse. Light sources have an efficiency of up to ~25%. That gives the total system an efficiency of 0.5%. To get rid of CO2, you have to put in 200 times the chemical energy necessary to do so.

You want to put this next to a coal power plant? That extracts up to ~50% of the chemical energy in coal. So if you use the whole power plant to power this CO2 removal system, you can remove 0.25% of the CO2 you just produced. The other 99.75% go into the atmosphere for nothing.

Future research might improve the efficiency, and use more of the sunlight spectrum, but currently the system is not practical on Earth. It is not even interesting on the ISS because the power consumption would exceed the whole electric power the station has.

And the system does not produce energy. It produces other carbon composites. You can burn them to get energy  - but then you produce the CO2 again, and due to the bad efficiency you lost energy without gaining anything.",0

&gt;An observation of sleep improvement with vitamin D supplementation led to a 2 year uncontrolled trial of vitamin D supplementation in 1500 patients with neurologic complaints who also had evidence of abnormal sleep. Most patients had improvement in neurologic symptoms and sleep but only through maintaining a narrow range of 25(OH) vitamin D3 blood levels of 60-80 ng/ml. Comparisons of brain regions associated with sleep-wake regulation and vitamin D target neurons in the diencephalon and several brainstem nuclei suggest direct central effects of vitamin D on sleep. We propose the hypothesis that sleep disorders have become epidemic because of widespread vitamin D deficiency. The therapeutic effects together with the anatomic-functional correspondence warrant further investigation and consideration of vitamin D in the etiology and therapy of sleep disorders.

there is some controversy in regards to what the ideal levels of vitamin-D is. most say below 20 is a problem. some say below 40. There are some reason to believe that the levels recomended here can confer health benefits but they probably  require more attention to co-factors (magnesium, K2 etc) in order to avoid problem.

&gt; Uncertainty is a fundamental feature of human life that can be fractioned into two distinct psychological constructs: risk (known probabilistic outcomes) and ambiguity (unknown probabilistic outcomes). Although risk and ambiguity are known to powerfully bias nonsocial decision-making, their influence on prosocial behavior remains largely unexplored. Here we show that ambiguity attitudes, but not risk attitudes, predict prosocial behavior: the greater an individual's ambiguity tolerance, the more they engage in costly prosocial behaviors, both during decisions to cooperate (experiments 1 and 3) and choices to trust (experiment 2). Once the ambiguity associated with another's actions is sufficiently resolved, this relationship between ambiguity tolerance and prosocial choice is eliminated (experiment 3). Taken together, these results provide converging evidence that attitudes toward ambiguity are a robust predictor of one's willingness to engage in costly social behavior, which suggests a mechanism for the underlying motivations of prosocial action.",0

&gt; The disappearance of an entire brain region should be cause for concern. Yet, for decades scientists have calmly maintained that one brain area, the subplate, simply vanishes during the course of human development. Recently, however, research has revealed genetic similarities between cells in the subplate and neurons implicated in autism-leading a team of Rockefeller scientists to wonder: what if subplate cells don't actually vanish at all?


&gt; In a new paper, which appears in Cell Stem Cell, Ali H. Brivanlou, the Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor, and postdoctoral associate Zeeshan Ozair demonstrate that subplate neurons survive, and in fact become part of the adult cerebral cortex, a brain area involved in complex cognitive functions. The team outlines a connection between subplate neurons and certain brain disorders, and further identifies a strategy for treating such disorders via innovative stem cell techniques.

hPSC Modeling Reveals that Fate Selection of Cortical Deep Projection Neurons Occurs in the Subplate.

Highlights

. Subplate neurons (SPNs) in vitro can generate cortex deep projection neurons (DPNs)
. SPNs in fetal cortex express multiple markers of DPNs and enter the cortical plate
. WNT signaling regulates post-mitotic projection neuron identity of SPNs
. SPNs in the caudal cortex are the only cells enriched in corticofugal neuron genes

Summary

Cortical deep projection neurons (DPNs) are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Although recent findings emphasize post-mitotic programs in projection neuron fate selection, the establishment of primate DPN identity during layer formation is not well understood. The subplate lies underneath the developing cortex and is a post-mitotic compartment that is transiently and disproportionately enlarged in primates in the second trimester. The evolutionary significance of subplate expansion, the molecular identity of its neurons, and its contribution to primate corticogenesis remain open questions. By modeling subplate formation with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we show that all classes of cortical DPNs can be specified from subplate neurons (SPNs). Post-mitotic WNT signaling regulates DPN class selection, and DPNs in the caudal fetal cortex appear to exclusively derive from SPNs. Our findings indicate that SPNs have evolved in primates as an important source of DPNs that contribute to cortical lamination prior to their known role in circuit formation.

They are being taught to write before they have developed the skills).

My own experience is, in an environment that relies heavily on positive reinforcement to correct behaviour, girls are rewarded significantly more often then boys are.  Their papers are more pretty, which pleases the mainly female teachers, so they get additional rewards that boys handing in the same content don't receive.

"4346",4400,"Plimpton 322 has been known for a long time.  The first theories by Neugebauer were that it was a trigonometric table, so none of this is new from what I can tell.  More importantly, many researchers think it is entirely incorrect that this is a trig table.  There is no other evidence that the ancient Babylonians utilized trig in their math.

Eleanor Robson, and others, argue that believing Plimpton 322 is a trig table completely ignores the culture, language, and practices of the region [1].  Her main proposal is that it was a table of solutions for use by a schoolteacher.  It would have been used to solve quadratic equations using a multistep process that was used in other tablets.  Even the Wikipedia article explains this and invalidates the trigonometric idea [2]

Some main reasons that this is most likely not a trig table is

* Why would the order they used be used.  There are many Pythagorean triples in between the ones shown on the tablet that are much smaller?
* Why are key columns missing (for example only the long side square is shown, but not the long side itself)
* This doesn't seem to be a definitive table, since there are no duplicates, implying it was for personal/site use (like a school) 

Even the cited article shows some experts wholeheartedly calling this hogwash.  I find it weird that Mansfield thinks that everyone else is wrong in this assessment without providing new information.

Abstract

A better understanding is needed of the factors that shape the development of individual differences in self-esteem. Using a prospective longitudinal design, this research tested whether the family environment in early childhood predicts self-esteem in later developmental periods. Data came from a nationally representative U.S. sample of 8,711 participants, who reported on their self-esteem biannually from age 8 to 27 years. Moreover, during the participants' first 6 years of life, biannual assessments of their mothers provided information on the quality of the home environment (covering quality of parenting, cognitive stimulation, and physical home environment), quality of parental relationship, presence of father, maternal depression, and poverty status of the family. The analyses were conducted using nonlinear regression analyses of age-dependent correlation coefficients, which were controlled for the effects of child gender and ethnicity. The results suggested that the family environment in early childhood significantly predicted self-esteem as the children grew up. Although the effects became smaller with age, the effects were still present during young adulthood. The largest effects emerged for quality of home environment. Moreover, the results suggested that the effects of home environment, presence of father, and poverty are enduring, as indicated by a nonzero asymptote in the time course of effects from age 8 to 27 years. Finally, quality of home environment partially accounted for the effects of the other predictors. The findings suggest that the home environment is a key factor in early childhood that influences the long-term development of self-esteem. ",0

Abstract

Background:
Neuroimaging studies imply that the regular use of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), the major constituent of ecstasy pills, alters the brain's serotonergic system in a dose-dependent manner. However, the relevance of these findings remains unclear due to limited knowledge about the ecstasy/MDMA use pattern of real-life users.

Aims:
We examined the representativeness of ecstasy users enrolled in neuroimaging studies by comparing their ecstasy use habits with the use patterns of a large, international sample.

Methods:
A systematic literature search revealed 10 imaging studies that compare serotonin transporter levels in recreational ecstasy users to matched controls. To characterize the ecstasy use patterns we relied on the Global Drug Survey, the world's largest self-report database on drug use. The basis of the dose comparison were the Usual Amount (pills/session), Use Frequency (sessions/month) and Dose Intensity (pills/year) variables.

Results:
Both the average Usual Amount (pills/session) and Use Frequency (sessions/month) of neuroimaging study participants corresponded to the top 5-10% of the Global Drug Survey sample and imaging participants, on average, consumed 720% more pills over a year than the Global Drug Survey participants.

Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that the serotonin brain imaging literature has focused on unusually heavy ecstasy use and therefore the conclusions from these studies are likely to overestimate the extent of serotonergic alterations experienced by the majority of people who use ecstays.

But these governments aren't forced to cut education, its just easier to cut that instead of fuel subsidies, direct welfare relief etc. Future vs current benefit mindset. 

The US often targets ""easy"" budget reductions i.e not medicaid, medicare, SS and defense. Even though those are nearly 2/3rds of the federal budget. It's just that our wealth and economy can sustain those expenses and people would be too upset if those were truly reduced. 

This study could just as easily say, impoverished nations who accept IMF funds, are often ill-managed and can't effectively maintain a sustainable budget. This requires the IMF to enact strict austerity measures which forces governments to cut spending to sustainable levels. A government temporarily spending beyond it's means could raise the health and education of a nation, but if it's forced to stop, then it follows that the nations health and education would fall. This article makes it sound like that fall is the IMF's fault.

&gt; With due respect to science, I'm tired to death of headlines or ledes like this based on a single ""new study."" The study could be great. Or it could be garbage. Give me a peer-reviewed, well-duplicated and time-tested body of evidence, and then I'll consider the validity of a claim like this.

So to analyze why this is good science and likely valid, let us examine the study and its design:

1. **The study was pre-registered** (At ClinicalTrials.gov: [NCT02211599](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02211599)), with a clear outline of the scope and methods (protocols) to be used. This avoids bias where only hypothesis-affirming data are reported and hypothesis-contradicting data are hidden or discarded. This has been a [major problem for pharmaceutical research](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/09/1094530773888.html) as well as other types in the past. Additionally, this avoids [p-value hacking](http://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/19817) ([FiveThurtyEight has a great interactive tool for playing with data to see how your choices affect the p-value](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/)) and spurrious relationships (which are [often found in nutritional studies](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-cant-trust-what-you-read-about-nutrition/)), where sub-group analyses ([obligatory xkcd](https://xkcd.com/882/)) are performed to find ""significant"" relationships. 
    * Upon inspection, it appears that the study followed [the design posted](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02211599). 
2. **The study was peer-reviewed**. In fact, this manuscript was examined using an ""[open peer review](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-588/v1)"" process, in which alongside the study, the reviewers' original comments are posted and names given, [here](https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-017-0170-2/open-peer-review). With the reviewers and editors names and comments all being open, as is [the case at this journal, BMC Nutrition](https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/about#peer-review+policy): *""The peer reviewers and editors are fully accountable for the decisions made, bias is reduced as reviewer reports are named, published reports can serve an educational purpose in helping facilitate training and research into peer review, and reviewers can get credit for their work.""*
    * **The reviewers affirmed the following:**
    * ""the methods appropriate and well described""
    * ""the work include[s] the necessary controls""
    * ""the conclusions drawn [are] adequately supported by the data shown""
    * Whether they are ""able to assess any statistics in the manuscript""
    * The reviewers also declare whether they have any ""competing interests""
3. **The paper is published in** (what most scientists would consider to be) **a [reputable journal](https://www.ediqo.com/blog/8-indicators-of-a-reputable-open-access-journal/) that is operated by a major publisher**, [BioMed Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioMed_Central), which is owned by the publishing giant, [Springer Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Nature). Other good publishing indicators are that the journal is sponsored by a major [scientific society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_society) and that esteemed scientists regularly publish in it. 
4. **The experiments are rigorous and relevant**: First, this is attested to by the reviewers who are more qualified in the field than I am (they're both professors in human nutrition; I'm a chemist / (nano)materials scientist). But as an outsider to the field, here are my observations:
    * The study controls for external variables (age, sex, lean body mass, diet for 3 days prior)
    * It [excluded those with characteristics](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02211599) which would complicate or invalidate the analysis (e.g. lactating / breastfeeding mothers have an energy output that would not be measured by the study's methods). 
    * [Summaries of the 29 subjects' characteristics and habitual dietary intake are provided](http://i.imgur.com/hijNigx.png)
    * They monitor outputs relevant to the metabolic processes in humans: O2 consumption; CO2 emission, thermal energy, air pressure, and nitrogen in urine. 
    &gt;  Volunteers spent *""24 hours in a metabolic chamber on two separate occasions. The metabolic chamber is a 12-by-10-foot hermetically controlled room. This allows us to measure exactly how the body is using the nutrients from the foods. By having someone stay in a metabolic chamber, we can determine how many grams of carbohydrate, protein and fat the volunteer is using and how many calories they're burning every minute.""*
    * There's a baseline for control:
    &gt; During one of the visits, they ate a diet consisting of 15% protein and for the other visit they ate a diet consisting of 30% protein.
    * The statistical methods and equations are supplied
    * TIL [Doppler radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_radar) can be used to for activity level monitoring indoors (e.g. [a thesis on the topic](http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0043206/00001)). Neat!

5. **The primary results are clear and present statistical significance**:
    * A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered significant. The effect of beverage type has a p-value of 0.0356. [Second obligatory xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1478/). 
    * I've summarized the corresponding data below, although using different units:
    * Fat Oxidation
    (grams of fat / kg of lean body mass / day)

    MALES|30% Energy from Protein|15% Energy from Protein|
    :--|:--|:--|
    Sugary Drink (SSB)|2.26 ± 0.59 g/kg(LBM)/day|2.45 ± 0.69|
    Artificially Sweetened Drink (NNSB)|2.52 ± 0.62|2.53 ± 0.73|

    FEMALES|30% Energy from Protein|15% Energy from Protein|
    :--|:--|:--|
    Sugary Drink (SSB)|2.40 ± 0.84 g/kg(LBM)/day|2.50 ± 0.8|
    Artificially Sweetened Drink (NNSB)|2.58 ± 0.89|2.72 ± 0.72|


    From the publication:

    &gt; There was a main effect of sex (p = 0.0043) and beverage type (p = 0.0356) on postprandial fat oxidation. Postprandial fat oxidation was greater in the males (161 ± 44 g/day) compared to the females (119 ± 37 g/day). Consuming a SSB with a meal suppressed fat oxidation compared to NNSB consumption (135 ± 45 g/day and 145 ± 46 g/day, respectively). On average, postprandial fat oxidation decreased by 7.2 ±11 g and 12.6 ± 11 g with the addition of a SSB to a meal (15% and 30% protein, respectively).

    Note: the inference used here is that if you are not *oxidizing* the fat that you eat (a.k.a. ""burning fat""), then you are *storing* the fat that you eat. Hence the data show that the sugar-sweetened beverage results in reduced fat burning, and the effect is bigger when more of the diet's energy comes from protein.

    From the linked summary:

    &gt; We found that drinking a sugar-sweetened drink with a meal significantly decreases fat use and diet-induced thermogenesis (heat production). And when we paired the sugar-sweetened drink with a protein-rich meal, the combination further decreased fat use and diet-induced thermogenesis by more than 40%. 

6. **The ancillary results show no unexpected or [confounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding) surprises.** This would not necessarily invalidate a paper, however it is a factor which increases the reader's assurance that nothing weird is going on.
    * e.g. [24h Energy Expenditure](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40795-017-0170-2/MediaObjects/40795_2017_170_MOESM4_ESM.jpg) is very strongly correlated with lean body mass... as you would expect.

7. **The publication is open access**: This is how science should ideally be done. It doesn't hurt to give a quick read to what is published before jumping all over the conclusions, as some are in the habit of doing. Even if it is not open-access, articles often are published to pre-print servers (e.g. [Arxiv.org](https://www.arxiv.org) for physics) or to the researchers' own online spaces. 

8. **No conflict of interest arising from the authors' personal interests or those of the funding agency or sponsors.**
    * The research was conducted as part of an academic research program at the  University of North Dakota.
    * ""The work is funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA): This work was supported by the Agricultural Research Services of the United States Department of Agriculture #5450-51,530-051-00D. The role of the finding sponsor was to approve the study and the submission of this manuscript for publication.""
    * ""The authors declare that they have no competing interest.""

One additional thing worth taking note: Many may not have realized, but the linked article is written by the first (and corresponding) author of the article which it summarizes. Hence the scientist here is likely not over-stating the results, as often happens with science journalism.

We've done something similar with wolves in Yellowstone in the past; replacing them with a close sub-species (Northern Rocky Mountains wolf (*Canis lupus irremotus*) vs the Mackenzie Valley wolf (*Canis lupus occidentalis*) though not the original to keep the ecosystem healthy.

Abstract:

&gt; Combining horizontal drilling with high volume hydraulic fracturing has increased extraction of hydrocarbons from low-permeability oil and gas (O&amp;G) formations across the United States; accompanied by increased wastewater production. Surface water discharges of O&amp;G wastewater by centralized waste treatment (CWT) plants pose risks to aquatic and human health. We evaluated the impact of surface water disposal of O&amp;G wastewater from CWT plants upstream of the Conemaugh River Lake (dam controlled reservoir) in western Pennsylvania. Regulatory compliance data were collected to calculate annual contaminant loads (Ba, Cl, total dissolved solids (TDS)) to document historical industrial activity. In this study, two CWT plants 10 and 19 km upstream of a reservoir left geochemical signatures in sediments and porewaters corresponding to peak industrial activity that occurred 5 to 10 years earlier. Sediment cores were sectioned for the collection of paired samples of sediment and porewater, and analyzed for analytes to identify unconventional O&amp;G wastewater disposal. Sediment layers corresponding to the years of maximum O&amp;G wastewater disposal contained higher concentrations of salts, alkaline earth metals, and organic chemicals. Isotopic ratios of 226Ra/228Ra and 87Sr/86Sr identified that peak concentrations of Ra and Sr were likely sourced from wastewaters that originated from the Marcellus Shale formation.",0

E-waste processing is also fairly labour intensive. It's more complex and harder to automate then conventional mining. Waste streams are also smaller, so you can't scale up the same way you can with regular mining operations.

Imagine having 20 years to plan and take care of your future self before symptoms even start showing up! Early stage dementia is *extremely* dangerous because it's so subtle, and it can get people into legal trouble, cause accidents, and interfere with decisionmaking (including about a person's healthcare and future...particularly if they're in deep denial). 

I mean, we can already make plans for our own healthcare if we're ever more obviously incapacitated, but the time between the undetected onset of symptoms and anything noticeably wrong to those around a patient (which is when most people get diagnosed) is when all sorts of stuff goes wrong. I'm a lawyer, and I recently won a case where my client committed a ""crime"" because of her early-stage dementia - it was hell to prove, but my client finally agreed to get tested despite the shock and shame of confronting the illness all at once in the worst possible setting. If she had known this disorder was in her future, her lovely family would have been ready to take care of her and she'd have gotten herself to the point of accepting that care. She wouldn't have been in the situation that caused her to mishandle money once the medical tests she would have gotten showed a problem. And honestly, not every lawyer would have won that case - if I hadn't caught the problem, she would be in prison right now, probably until her death came earlier and in less comfort than she can have now, and I only caught it because my grandfather had the same thing.

Early detection lets people make plans that are for sure what they want for their future selves, in terms of wills, guardianships, healthcare, and psychological/spiritual readiness. I wish more people knew about these issues and talked to their doctors (and lawyers) about it, because dementia is horrifying, but you're so much less helpless if you take care of your future self before you can no longer make those decisions or reach out for the help and support you need.

In situations that would be highly stressful for others, such as difficult meetings with important customers, many of those surveyed felt at ease and stimulated. ""Their impulsiveness, resulting from ADHD, gives them the advantage of being able to act under unforeseen circumstances without falling into anxiety and paralysis,"" says Patzelt.

Most of those surveyed act without thinking, even when making far-reaching decisions. One of the entrepreneurs described buying a friend's company over lunch. He only learned of the friend's plan to retire during the meal. Other participants reported that they make investments with no strategy and commit large sums of money to projects with highly uncertain outcomes. Some entrepreneurs believe that this kind of quick decision making is the only way to be productive, and are willing to live with setbacks as a result. Some have difficulty coping with structured activities.

""A marked willingness to try out new things and take risks is an important entrepreneurial trait,"" says Patzelt. However, the respondents' impulsive actions led to success only when they focused on activities essential to the development of their businesses. One disadvantage of their impulsiveness was mentioned by all of them: problems with routine tasks such as bookkeeping.

In the US, the majority of schools are taught in English. Academic language at school is higher quality than home language, which is more basic interpersonal communication. Thus, you have a higher quality input of English than Spanish in US schools, and it's expected that as the student continues in school, their Spanish skills will not keep up with English because there has been less exposure to academic vocabulary and complex grammatical sentences. This is called *subtractive bilingualism.* This is what they mean by 'quality over quantity.'

The number of honeybee colonies is irrelevant. It's winter deaths that are concerning. Before this crisis (I'd say pre 2005) you could start with 1000 hives and have 100 die over the winter. Then you use your existing 900 hives to create 100 new hives to bring you back to 1000 total hives by spring. 

More recently it's common to start with 1000 hives, have 500 die, and have to make up 500. We haven't yet reached the point where we can't keep up with the death, but the more new hives you need to make in the spring, the weaker all of your hives become. 

So when people say that the number of colonies is at an all time high, it really just means that we haven't yet reached the point where we can't make enough new hives to cover our hives.  That's not taking into account new beekeepers entering the industry, which wouldn't surprise me at all considering the high honey/pollination prices. 

Wild bees ARE in trouble because there isn't that human intervention to bring their colonies back up. When they suffer a period of heavy losses, it's much harder for them to bounce back by themselves.

When you look at actuarial tables by BMI categories, it turns out that those who are classified as overweight have lower risks of mortality compared to those who are normal weight. The authors believe that this is because people often lose weight before death, so someone who used to be obese could be sick enough to become normal weight, inflating the risks in that category. This is called reverse causation.

By looking at maximum BMI over a weight history period, the authors were able to separate those who maintained a normal weight over 16 years as opposed to those who dropped into it from a higher weight category (most likely due to illness). When you use that maximum normal weight as the reference group, the obesity paradox goes away.

**Edit: Damnit, I can do better than this!**

v1.2 Baby Boomers are very unhappy that their inability to retire when planned (due to the fiscal irresponsibility allowed to thrive during their prime decades due to a lack of regulatory oversight and a collective failure to recognize the unsustainability of the unskilled job benefits and material lifestyles they enjoyed when juxtaposed with the rise of technology-fueled globalization and task automation) has prevented the Millennials, who they blame for the social ills and lifestyle expectations that they were born into, from occupying and ascending through living-wage professions and forced those same financially-stymied adults to return ""home"" to Mom &amp; Dad --and also, because they forget that us GenXers exist.

**Edit 2:** After reviewing the end of the document, I'd like to point out that in societies where intergenerational co-habitation is perceived as normal, healthy, desirable and as a burden-relief (welcome family interdependence) rather than burden-acquisition, the parents' Quality of Life (QOL) is not diminished by the return of their offspring --it's improved.  It's the western perception of offspring returning as ""their failure"" and ""our burden"" that generates dissatisfaction.  This bit on the unhappy parents is key:

&gt;Parents enjoy their independence when their children leave the home, and **refilling an empty nest may be regarded as a violation of this life course stage** (Settersten, 1998; White and Edwards, 1990; VanLaningham et al., 2001).

If a company moves in, they typically add only a small handful of meaningful jobs. Jobs that people all around the world want. Jobs that require education. Most rural Americans don't have that.

"5651",5722,"There are a lot of comments here suggesting that women avoid STEM fields due to disinterest, family planning decisions, or less pressure to provide, but I'm not seeing very much scientific evidence for these assumptions.

What we do have evidence for, however, is that in some STEM institutions, women are discriminated against in terms of pay, hiring, and mentorship.
&gt;In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. (1)

**Where women have greater social and economic equality generally, but are consistently subject to discrimination more severely in some fields than others, it's reasonable that they would avoid more hostile fields. Where discrimination is more ubiquitous, there is no reason to avoid specific fields.**

We also know that in the US, women tend to avoid fields in which success is generally perceived to be the result of innate genius, not just hard work, regardless of whether or not that's true (2), and that from an early age, little girls are conditioned to believe that they do not possess the same innate intellectual ability for STEM subjects as boys. Naturally, this affects their expectations of themselves, their interests in STEM fields, and their perceptions of what fields they can/should aspire to (3). **These perceptions could differ across cultures, and again, greater hostility toward working women  in general can mean that no one field is more or less hostile to women then others.**

"13981",14184,"This paper reeks of catchy science with essentially no contribution to the field. The n values are tiny. No attempt at determining a mechanism is made. Amount of grey matter is not a widely accepted metric of cognitive abilities in neuroscience--all previous work here is only correlative. This work is not published in a very reputable journal. This type of science is misleading to the public and counterproductive. 


Edit: I recommend reading some of the responses below. There are some differences of opinion. My experience comes from being a molecular neuroscientist (just so everyone is aware of my potential biases). 

A few clarifications and responses:

I agree, PlosOne is not a garbage journal. However, it does accept a lot of papers and has a lot of papers like this one where the findings are incomplete at best. Some people mentioned how this study this may spark future studies. I agree, that this could definitely be true. Due to their poorly powered experiment, there is a chance that these findings aren't reproducible, though. This may lead future scientists down a wild goose chase. 

What would make me believe their findings more would be if they more broadly tested cognition and/or if they determined a mechanism of action. They did some behavioral work but the effect size was small. It was a good starting point, but they needed more, in my opinion. They speculated at mechanism but offer no data (to be fair, it would be really challenging to get at a mechanism with their techniques). Also, this whole study is based on the premise that more grey matter means greater cognitive abilities. This relationship has never been causally shown. To my knowledge, all previous work has shown correlations between grey matter amount and cognitive abilities. While this thought seems intuitive, biology isn't always intuitive. 

I want to step back a little on my last claim. I still think that this paper is misleading to the public, but I don't think it's necessarily the authors' fault. At the end of the day, this is not something the public should get excited about (at least not yet). It's unclear that this will lead to cognitive benefits across a broad demographic, and then from there, it's unclear how or if this would develop into a therapy. A lot more work has to be done. ",0

"13016",13202,"Sorry to say, but atoms don't *'naturally restructure'* themselves to *burn* more energy.

Atoms just naturally *burn*.  Burning meaning that there is a lower-energy state they can reach, and they can achieve the minimum activation energy to start the process that gets them there.

If you leave a bunch of wood in a pile, the atoms will not naturally form a match, or a 9 volt battery, to generate a spark.  They will burn if any part of them gets hot enough. And once they start burning, the self-catalyzing fire will burn it all up.  But nothing will restructure itself with the goal to burn later.  Things don't deliberately energize themselves to overcome barriers.  They just proceed with processes once an energy barrier is overcome.

Atoms were, and are, not directed by some entropic life-force that says: *""Make big, complex, homeostatic systems that actively go about lowering the energy of their surroundings so we can eventually burn all the carbon into carbondioxide and eventually fuse all the stars into Iron.""*

As a rule, thermodynamics can tell you *if* something will happen, but not *when* it will happen.  So the idea that 'thermodynamics' makes life inevitable, under the justification that life drives entropy *more quickly* - you've got a huge contradiction in concepts.

Thermodynamics doesn't care if the end result occurs from life covering the galaxy and burning up all the resources and eventually speeding up the fusion process in stars, or if it waits around for 10^40 years for all the protons to decay.

Life is interesting to think about, as a little self-sustaining bubble of order that speeds up everything around it in the universe, and drives entropy.  But you can't take that concept and reverse it around to say that such a thing is *inevitable* or *meant to be* just because it's interesting and favorable.  It's pretty much exactly the same as asserting that evolutionary processes have some sort of *'goal'* in mind when it *'makes'* things the way they are, when in reality evolution just describes the process by which certain things became unique after being randomly generated amid every other alternative.  It's a post-occurance analysis, not a pre-occurance motivation.

The point of the 2017 research was that it proved the inactive ants are a reserve labor force. The existence of the inactive ants is not a new finding; that was discovered back in 2015.

&gt; **Significance:** In Bali, the cooperative management of rice terraces extends beyond villages to whole watersheds. To understand why, we created a model that explores how cooperation can propagate from pairs of individuals to extended groups, creating a resilient system of bottom-up management that both increases and equalizes harvests. Spatial patterns of collective crop management-observable in Google Earth-closely match the predictions of the model. The spatial patterning that emerges is nonuniform and scale-free. Although the model parameters here are tuned to Bali, similar mechanisms of emergent global control should be detectible in other anthropogenic landscapes using multispectral imagery. Recognizing this signature of emergent system-wide cooperation may help planners to avoid unproductive changes to successful bottom-up systems of environmental management.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Abstract:** Spatial patterning often occurs in ecosystems as a result of a self-organizing process caused by feedback between organisms and the physical environment. Here, we show that the spatial patterns observable in centuries-old Balinese rice terraces are also created by feedback between farmers' decisions and the ecology of the paddies, which triggers a transition from local to global-scale control of water shortages and rice pests. We propose an evolutionary game, based on local farmers' decisions that predicts specific power laws in spatial patterning that are also seen in a multispectral image analysis of Balinese rice terraces. The model shows how feedbacks between human decisions and ecosystem processes can evolve toward an optimal state in which total harvests are maximized and the system approaches Pareto optimality. It helps explain how multiscale cooperation from the community to the watershed scale could persist for centuries, and why the disruption of this self-organizing system by the Green Revolution caused chaos in irrigation and devastating losses from pests. The model shows that adaptation in a coupled human-natural system can trigger self-organized criticality (SOC). In previous exogenously driven SOC models, adaptation plays no role, and no optimization occurs. In contrast, adaptive SOC is a self-organizing process where local adaptations drive the system toward local and global optima.

"1869",1893,"A little hype mitigation:

1) The anisotropic conductivity is useful for something like a heat shield--protecting nearby materials or electronics from a flame or heating element, for example.  But for such applications, high-temperature capability is typically needed.  It doesn't seem likely that this material would survive high temperature well at all.  Also, it's easy to create a composite material with much better lateral thermal conductivity by stacking layers of aluminum and insulation.

2) The usefulness in building applications is likely limited by production cost and, as someone else mentioned, flammability.  The claim of ""much more environmentally friendly"" would require investigation of things like the energy use in the freeze-drying process and consideration of how the chemicals used in removing the lignin are managed. 

3) The combination of low thermal conductivity and moderately high strength could be useful in many building applications, if the other issues are addressed.  I'm disappointed that the authors didn't compare it to materials that target that combination such as [Compacfoam](http://www.compacfoam.com/26-compressive-strength.html) and [Foamglas](https://industry.foamglas.com/en-gb/products/foamglas-hlb-insulation/grades-and-formats).  It does appear that they have achieved a better combination of those two properties than the commercially available materials.  Both the commercial materials are completely waterproof, which is not the case for this material.  In some applications that doesn't matter, and in some others, the moisture permeability of the new material is actually an advantage.

4) The low emissivity is interesting but is not likely to be of much practical value.  It's only in the solar spectrum range, not in the thermal radiation range where it would be of value for insulation.  To be useful in reflecting unwanted solar radiation, it would need to be exposed to the sun, but it's not likely to hold up to rain or UV radiation if it was used exposed on a roof, for example.  Also, white paint can accomplish a similar function, and there are white paints that work pretty well outdoors.

Thanks in advance!",0
"9468",9598,"Hello, and thanks for doing this AMA!
I have three questions:

1) I hope you could shed some light on the statistics choices in your paper. In your supplemental materials you say: ""We did not apply Bonferroni corrections as the lack of independence for the majority of the response variables (e.g. different life stages of honey bee) meant that there was no valid level for the correction.""

My understanding is, that when you have this many measurements, it is very important to make appropriate statistical corrections, to avoid the inevitable scenario that some measurements will randomly turn up significant. In your results, you get mostly non-significant results, then a handful of significant differences to both, negative and positive directions. Isn't this what you would expect, when you do not correct for such a large number of measurements?

An agricultural virologist I know has pointed out just this concern:

""This is a serious issue that I'll explain below.

First it's important to understand why correction for taking multiple measurements is vital. The main reason why researchers do this is because when many things are measured, the likelihood of false positives being found increases as the number of measurements increases. To counteract this, researchers will adjust the P-value to limit the risk of false positives (called a Type I error in statistics). The Bonferroni correction is a common method for doing this. It adjusts the resulting P-value so that it is smaller when more measurements are taken. Some researchers do not like it because it tends to be more conservative; however, not using it, or other methods for correction of multiple tests, introduces false positives in research.

In the supplemental materials and methods, the researchers claim that they were not taking independent measurements. However, this is not entirely accurate. The best way to describe these measures is semi-independent. As an example, the number of brood and their health directly impacts the future number worker bees and the survival numbers the next winter. However, the number of workers the following winter does not impact the number of brood the previous spring. Furthermore, their reason for not using Bonferroni Correction does not make sense as the measurements are semi-independent. The Bonferroni Correction is only one method to reduce the rate of false discovery. This method may or may not be correct in this case, but there are other methods for correcting the false discovery rate of dependent data. It is very risky to not perform any correction of large data sets like this when there are so many measurements being taken. It really doesn't look like a statistician was consulted for this paper and the quality suffers as a result. "" http://themadvirologist.blogspot.ch/2017/07/bees-neonicotinoids-statistics-and.html

Did you have statistical consultation on the study when it was set up, or when you analysed your results? If you analyse them using Bonferroni or similar corrections, would you still see significant findings?

2) Connected question is, if you do think your results have causatively suggestive power on the specific effect of neonicotinoids, how do you explain the beneficial effects? Say, in the UK, clothiadinin appeared to negatively impact storage cell numbers, whereas thiametoxam appeared to boost them? Looking at the raw data table released from Syngenta, it also appears that clothiadinin was responsible for almost all the negative effect, whereas thiametoxam results returned mostly beneficial impacts. Do you think this a real effect, and if so, how do you think neonicotinoids might achieve such an effect?

3) The third question I am concerned about, is bee disease. There is a lot of research highlighting bee pests and pathogens as one of the largest, if not the largest factor negatively affecting bee health.

You report that some colonies were wiped out by the varroa mite entirely in the UK, where you found bee health was generally shakier. Did you monitor and treat your hives for Varroa? Did you track the presence of viral or bacterial infections? Wouldn't this be important information to have at hand, considering the large impact of bee diseases, evidenced also by the colony losses of the study hives?

Thank you very much in advance for your answers.

This seems to be a huge leap to a conclusion that ignores the fact that society's ideas about homosexuality are what's changed and not the church's stand on it. I also don't see where it addresses the social reasons that people used to attend church, how those have changed, and how it's affected attendance. This article makes it sound like the church and its teachings have been changing and we're losing congregants over it, whereas our doctrines haven't changed that much over the years and some Christian doctrines even predate Christianity itself. 

&gt;""By 2010, a ban (on gay marriage) was in place in 29 states,"" they write. ""These states were more likely to be evangelical, and had smaller populations of 'nones' in them in 2006. But by 2010, that gap between the 'nones' in marriage-ban states and those in states with no marriage ban had been cut in half.""

&gt;This suggests that, in those traditionally religious states, the anti-gay-rights campaign soiled the name of religion for a significant number of residents, and they responded by stepping away from their former faith.


No, it doesn't suggest it, unless you want it to. This could suggest the societal need for attendance was fading from those states later than states with a lesser population of Christians. [Social ostracism](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3669020821/family-ostracism-in-christianity-and-counseling) is no longer as much of an issue as in times past. With the advent of social media, we can all instantly be in touch with like-minded individuals. In this case, the LGBT community and its supporters were fighting to change laws that had existed for a long time, it wasn't that the church decided to try and outlaw homosexuality. Society changed, not the church, I'm not sure why they are implying the members were surprised to find out the church's stance on homosexuality when the LGBT rights movement became an issue. Anyhow, I think the authors had a huge blind spot when they put this together.

Abstract:

&gt; The 2014 Surgeon General's Report on smoking and health concluded that changing cigarette designs have caused an increase in lung adenocarcinomas, implicating cigarette filter ventilation that lowers smoking machine tar yields. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now has the authority to regulate cigarette design if doing so would improve public health. To support a potential regulatory action, two weight-of-evidence reviews were applied for causally relating filter ventilation to lung adenocarcinoma. Published scientific literature (3284 citations) and internal tobacco company documents contributed to causation analysis evidence blocks and the identification of research gaps. Filter ventilation was adopted in the mid-1960s and was initially equated with making a cigarette safer. Since then, lung adenocarcinoma rates paradoxically increased relative to other lung cancer subtypes. Filter ventilation 1) alters tobacco combustion, increasing smoke toxicants; 2) allows for elasticity of use so that smokers inhale more smoke to maintain their nicotine intake; and 3) causes a false perception of lower health risk from ""lighter"" smoke. Seemingly not supportive of a causal relationship is that human exposure biomarker studies indicate no reduction in exposure, but these do not measure exposure in the lung or utilize known biomarkers of harm. Altered puffing and inhalation may make smoke available to lung cells prone to adenocarcinomas. The analysis strongly suggests that filter ventilation has contributed to the rise in lung adenocarcinomas among smokers. Thus, the FDA should consider regulating its use, up to and including a ban. Herein, we propose a research agenda to support such an effort.",0

&gt; Our results also suggest that changes in vaccination behavior may relate to adverse reactions to vaccine. In particular, parents who had an older child with autism spectrum disorder retrospectively reported a higher rate of adverse reactions to vaccination among the older child than did those who did not have an older child with autism (22.6% vs. 3.8%; Pearson chi-square value with one degree of freedom, 16.87; P&lt;0.001). Likewise, parents who had an older child with autism retrospectively reported a higher rate of these reactions among the infant sibling than did those who did not have an older child with autism (6.9% vs. 0.8%; Pearson chi-square value with one degree of freedom, 5.87; P=0.02). Reported reactions included fever, diarrhea, unusual crying or screaming, and general malaise. These differences in reported reactions may reflect either a true increase or a recall bias, and they warrant larger prospective studies of adverse reactions to vaccine with the use of more objective measures, such as medical records and examination after vaccination, in children in whom autism spectrum disorder ultimately develops.

The authors note that in their cohort, there were more reports of vaccine-related adverse events in children who had an older sibling with autism.

&gt; I-sharing is most powerful among people who feel existential isolation. And current research headed by Peter Helm at the University of Arizona shows that existential isolation tends to be stronger among men than women. But why?


&gt; In a follow up survey they found that valuing communal traits (e.g., kindness, warmth, empathy) was associated with less existential isolation. Further, the reason males had more existential isolation than females was because women tended to value communal traits more highly.


&gt; This work is consistent with a broad range of research showing that males are restricted in the range of emotions that are deemed socially acceptable (at least males tend to think this). Being warm, kind, and emotional really at all (except for anger) is not viewed by males as desirable (relative to for females). As such, males feel existential isolation, because they accept social norms that impede their ability to truly connect with other people.

Abstract:

Existential isolation (EI) is the subjective experience of feeling fundamentally separate from other human beings. Recent studies examining EI have observed a consistent sex difference wherein men report higher levels of EI than women. Our first study used a large undergraduate survey. It replicated the sex difference in EI and showed that controlling for loneliness and self-esteem did not account for this difference. Study 2 replicated this pattern using an online sample, and tested the hypothesis that this difference may be mediated by the sex difference in endorsement of communal and agentic values. We found that sex differences in endorsement of communal (but not agentic) values mediated the sex difference in EI. However, agentic value endorsement played no role. These findings indicate that men may be higher in existential isolation because they do not endorse communal values as much as women do. This suggests that one way to reduce the disproportionate experience of EI among men may be to increase their endorsement of communal values.

Abstract

Corneal transplantation constitutes one of the leading treatments for severe cases of loss of corneal function. Due to its limitations, a concerted effort has been made by tissue engineers to produce functional, synthetic corneal prostheses as an alternative recourse. However, successful translation of these therapies into the clinic has not yet been accomplished. 3D bioprinting is an emerging technology that can be harnessed for the fabrication of biological tissue for clinical applications. We applied this to the area of corneal tissue engineering in order to fabricate corneal structures that resembled the structure of the native human corneal stroma using an existing 3D digital human corneal model and a suitable support structure. These were 3D bioprinted from an in-house collagen-based bio-ink containing encapsulated corneal keratocytes. Keratocytes exhibited high cell viability both at day 1 post-printing (&gt;90%) and at day 7 (83%). We established 3D bio-printing to be a feasible method by which artificial corneal structures can be engineered.

&gt;""It is also possible that the sex difference in efficiency is due in part to facility with the interface or navigation in virtual environments, as men tend to spend more time playing video games,"" speculates Boone.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore the researchers believe that it will be important in future research to examine whether the same results are found when people navigate in real environments, rather than virtual environments.

I think men tending to play more video games and therefore being more familiar navigating in virtual spaces surely has something to do with it, but also the fact that in a virtual environment there's no real risk of injury or consequence, which probably just amplifies the risk\-taking behavior in men.

I think it also could explain the tendency for women to wander in these scenarios. It correlates with the tendency of women when playing video games to spend more time exploring the environment than trying to reach the goal as quickly as possible.

I don't think we can really draw any conclusions about efficiency or safety because these aren't really factors in a virtual environment. Reading the study, I didn't see anywhere in the instructions given that participants were told to reach their destination as quickly as possible, just that they were told to navigate from one point to another.

This study investigated the possibility that these misconceptions may be reflective of science teachers' knowledge and teaching of climate change science. Florida and Puerto Rico secondary science teachers who claim to teach extensively about climate change were surveyed in regard to their conceptions of climate change science and the climate change-related topics they teach. Results show that many teachers hold naïve views about climate change (e.g. that ozone layer depletion is a primary cause of climate change) and climate change science (e.g. that it must be based on controlled experiments for it to be valid). In addition, teachers in both groups neglect crucial topics such as how evidence for climate change is developed and the social, political, and economic dimensions of climate change. Our results suggest the need for teachers to understand how to teach climate change and the nature of climate change science using authentic contexts that promote effective socioscientific decision-making and climate change mitigation.

On January 1, 2017, Philadelphia implemented a beverage tax of $0.015/ounce on sugar (""regular"") and sugar-substitute (""diet"") beverages. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate impact of the tax on residents' consumption of soda, fruit drinks, energy drinks, and bottled water.

Methods: A repeat cross-sectional study design used data from a random-digit-dialing phone survey during a no-tax period (December 6-31, 2016) and a tax period (January 15-February 31, 2017) among 899 respondents in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and 878 respondents in three nearby comparison cities. Survey questions included frequency and volume of bottled water and beverages. Outcomes were daily consumption, and 30-day consumption frequency and volume. Propensity score-weighted difference-in-differences regression was used to control for secular time trend and confounding. Covariates were sociodemographics, BMI, health status, smoking, and alcohol use. Analyses were conducted in 2017.

Results: Within the first 2 months of tax implementation, relative to the comparison cities, in Philadelphia the odds of daily consumption of regular soda was 40% lower (OR=0.6, 95% CI=0.37, 0.97); energy drink was 64% lower (OR=0.36, 95% CI=0.17, 0.76); bottled water was 58% higher (OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.13, 2.20); and the 30-day regular soda consumption frequency was 38% lower (ratio of consumption frequency=0.62, 95% CI=0.40, 0.98).

Edit: typo 

Second edit: I didn't think this would blow up so much. I'm not a child psych expert, and I don't mean to speak as one. I am a student studying to be an occupational therapist, and I work a lot in pediatrics. Yes, children can do things despite their morals, we all do, but what I meant is that children who are taught how to weigh a desired action versus consequence for the action will often choose to not act out, not always, but more so than children who only know that ""Mom and Dad hit me sometimes when I do things"". Even if you do chose to spank your child, you should talk to them about  *why* they are facing a consequence and which action cause it, AND what the child should have done instead. In my personal experience (was a preschool teacher in the past), children do better when they know what is expected of them before entering a situation. For example, ""We are going to the grocery store today. When we are at the grocery store, I hope you will use your inside voice and listen to what I say. If you do these things, we can go to the park afterwards, if you don't do these things, we will have to go straight home instead of going to the park. Let's both be on our best behavior so that we can go to the park"".

Abstract

&gt; Income is known to be associated with happiness1, but debates persist about the exact nature of this relationship2,3. Does happiness rise indefinitely with income, or is there a point at which higher incomes no longer lead to greater well-being? We examine this question using data from the Gallup World Poll, a representative sample of over 1.7 million individuals worldwide. Controlling for demographic factors, we use spline regression models to statistically identify points of 'income satiation'. Globally, we find that satiation occurs at $95,000 for life evaluation and $60,000 to $75,000 for emotional well-being. However, there is substantial variation across world regions, with satiation occurring later in wealthier regions. We also find that in certain parts of the world, incomes beyond satiation are associated with lower life evaluations. These findings on income and happiness have practical and theoretical significance at the individual, institutional and national levels. They point to a degree of happiness adaptation4,5 and that money influences happiness through the fulfilment of both needs and increasing material desires6.",0

2) are these conditions themselves associated with an increased risk of miscarriage?

because the danger is that if it is the Condition that is the problem, and the antibiotic chosen is simply a marker for that condition, then if clinicians and/or patients start getting reluctant to prescribe those antibiotics, the upshot might actually be an Increase in miscarriages.

The original paper looks more like it's not trying to say there is no gaming addiction, but rather moving the needle and reframing the debate a bit.  Games are empowering, provide positive reinforcement, and stimulate the brain more than movies or TV to the average brain because you interact, not just watch.

The more developed a culture/society the higher the average IQ, as while genetic can determine potential, actually reaching it is dependant on a lot of environmental factors. 

In my view, which is novel, said lower education results in higher religiosity, which has a side effect of lower IQ due to education, places with lower education capabilities likely will also be poorer, less developed, with more social problems and higher religious adherence by the community, leading to the other missing factors that are required for Flyn effect.

Abstract:

&gt; Research conducted on workplace incivility-a low intensity form of deviant behavior-has generally shown that women report higher levels of incivility at work. However, to date, it is unclear as to whether women are primarily treated uncivilly by men (i.e., members of the socially dominant group/out-group) or other women (i.e., members of in-group) in organizations. In light of different theorizing surrounding gender and incivility, we examine whether women experience increased incivility from other women or men, and whether this effect is amplified for women who exhibit higher agency and less communion at work given that these traits and behaviors violate stereotypical gender norms. Across three complementary studies, results indicate that women report experiencing more incivility from other women than from men, with this effect being amplified for women who are more agentic at work. Further, agentic women who experience increased female-instigated incivility from their coworkers report lower well-being (job satisfaction, psychological vitality) and increased work withdrawal (turnover intentions). Theoretical implications tied to gender and incivility are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0

New research from King's College London shows that lonely young adults are more likely to experience mental health problems and more likely to be out of work than their peers. The study, published today in Psychological Medicine, gives a detailed snapshot of the lives of lonely 18-year-olds and shows how loneliness goes hand-in-hand with a wide range of problems in health and wellbeing.

Loneliness is strongly linked with premature death in old age, to a similar degree as smoking or obesity. With increasing attention on loneliness as a major public health issue, the study highlights the importance of early intervention to prevent young adults being trapped in loneliness as they age.

**Abstract**. In six studies (*N* = 1,143), we investigated *social psychological skill* - lay individuals' skill at predicting social psychological phenomena (e.g., social loafing, attribution effects). Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated reliable individual differences in social psychological skill. In Studies 2, 3, and 4, attributes associated with decreased cognitive and motivational bias - cognitive ability, cognitive curiosity, and melancholy and introversion - predicted social psychological skill. Studies 4 and 5 confirmed that social psychological skill is distinct from other skills (e.g., test-taking skills, intuitive physics), and relates directly to reduced motivational bias (i.e., self-deception). In Study 6, social psychological skill related to appreciating the situational causes of another individual's behavior - reduced fundamental attribution error.

If I were to believe these results (the paper says it was an online survey panel and says that they acknowledge they have problems) that still doesn't mean much. The #1 question is 'would any of these laws do anything' and the answer tends to always be 'no'. The Bureau of Justice did an investigation after the ten-year 'assault weapon ban' experiment ended and concluded that it had no real impact at all. Furthermore, we always see spikes for these laws after a shooting, even if the shooting had nothing to do with anything proposed. Support for banning 'large capacity magazines' was up after the Parkland shooting, but zero large-capacity magazines were involved in the shooting.

Which brings me to my point: I firmly believe that gun control is about 'revenge porn' on gun owners - not an actual honest attempt to increase safety. Nobody can actually make a coherent argument as to why a two ounce plastic pistol grip makes a rifle suddenly incredibly dangerous, but it's on every single 'assault weapon ban' list. 

Even if a lot of people support a law, that doesn't mean it's a good law that should exist. Do they actually know enough about the subject matter to properly articulate their support for a law? Is there a reason to believe the law would be effective? Do the drawbacks of the law outweigh the potential benefits? Is the law constitutional and ethical?

There are a lot of measures gun owners agree with - universal background checks, for example.

The problem is the implementation. Gun owners want a Switzerland-style system where you go to the post office, get a background check certificate, and then present it to a seller (be it at a gun store or a private party). They have a verification code they can use to see if the certificate is valid and verify the name it was issued to. And that's it. Gun owners really want this because it would take power away from predatory gun stores who charge $35-$50 *per gun* on a background check.

Dems don't want this, but they won't really say why. And this is going to lead into the second half of my post:

*I firmly believe that the vast majority of gun control proposed by 'non-gun owners' (or ""anti-gunners"" as is probably more accurate to call them) are done to be malicious to gun owners, not to save lives.*

When you look at the kind of gun laws that constantly get proposed, with almost zero reasonable explanation for them, occam's razor comes down to most of them being 'revenge porn'. People blame all gun owners for the actions of an individual and want 'justice'.",0

Many of whom have been or ultimately become scientists in the Chinese system before/after leaving out institute.  Not meaning to sound racist, I admire and respect my Chinese colleagues, it's more about the system they come out of than any intrinsic abilities, but the Chinese scientists are often not the most creative thinkers especially the first year or so after they arrive.  A few sometimes eventually blossom once they realize they're free to pursue their ideas so long as they have scientific merit.  The Americans, Europeans and often Indians tend to find it much easier to come up with original hypotheses and experimental designs, due in part I think to the less beurocratic education systems that produces them.  From what they tell me, in China it's all about performance on standardized tests.  Nothing else matters.  Test scores are the only way to get into a science program in a good college over there.  And leadership in academic research labs is very top down and traditional Chinese style. 

I've seen that the traditional Chinese style of leadership in some of the Chinese led labs here in the US also tends to hamper creative thinking.

**Abstract:**

&gt;Nearly a third of all U.S. workers, primarily lower-paid employees, do not have paid sick leave benefits, prompting some lawmakers to consider mandating paid sick leave for all U.S. employees so workers can access timely health care without lost wages. A representative sample of 19,537 workers in current paid employment was examined, searching for the association between access to paid sick leave benefits and receipt of six different welfare and welfare-related services. After controlling for relevant demographic, work, income, and medical/health care variables, results of the logistic models indicate that, among working adults age 18-64, those without paid sick leave are 1.41 times more likely to receive income from a state or county welfare program, 1.36 times more likely to receive other welfare assistance (transportation and child care supports), 1.33 times more likely to received sponsored rental assistance, and 1.34 times more likely to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (referred to as food stamps commonly and in this article). Mandating paid sick leave benefits may impact usage of social welfare assistance since families with paid sick leave do not have to lose wages when work is missed because of health and caregiver responsibilities.

**Abstract:**

&gt;Secondary data analysis on the 2015 National Health Interview Survey was conducted to determine if having paid sick leave increases the odds of being able to afford specific health care goods and services, and not having access to paid sick leave increases the odds of being in poverty, being food insecure and having elevated medical costs among a representative sample of US workers age 18-64. We found a statistically significant association between paid sick leave and ability to afford dental care, eyeglasses and prescription medication. Workers who lack paid sick leave are more likely than those with paid sick leave to be in poverty and have high medical costs. In conclusion, we found a relationship between paid sick leave benefits and being able to afford needed healthcare services and goods and being more vulnerable to economic hardship.",0

&gt; Hanbyul Choi and colleagues (2018), of the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (Korea), propose that after years and years of hearing about threats to people's security of public self-disclosures, it's easy to experience what they call ""privacy fatigue."" Relating more to Internet use than those public displays of personal information in real-life settings, Choi et al define this phenomenon as ""a sense of weariness toward privacy issues, in which individuals believe that there is no effective means of managing their personal information on the Internet"" (p. 42). Although people vary in their degree of privacy fatigue, the Korean authors believe that we're all getting a little sick and tired of having to draw a boundary around personal information for the sake of protection from online or real-life threats by others wishing to do harm.


&gt; Privacy fatigue, Choi et al. argue, is just like any other form of fatigue in which you become weary of trying to meet too many demands on you, leading to perpetual exhaustion. In the extreme, you experience burnout and become frustrated, hopeless, and disillusioned (otherwise known as cynical). More importantly, you begin to feel that you lack the self-efficacy to do what you need to do to accomplish your goals. In the case of privacy fatigue, then, you feel that you just can't keep up with the need to maintain your vigilance about sharing personal information. You leak things out on Facebook, share your exercise tracking, dietary intake, and weight data with an online fitness app, and tell anyone in your vicinity about how you really feel about the various people in your life. Given the ""6 degrees of separation"" phenomenon, this latter leakage can create real problems for you because you never know who knows those friends and family of yours.

Abstract

&gt; The increasing difficulty in managing one's online personal data leads to individuals feeling a loss of control. Additionally, repeated consumer data breaches have given people a sense of futility, ultimately making them weary of having to think about online privacy. This phenomenon is called ""privacy fatigue."" Although privacy fatigue is prevalent and has been discussed by scholars, there is little empirical research on the phenomenon. This study aimed not only to conceptualize privacy fatigue but also to examine its role in online privacy behavior. Based on literature on burnout, we developed measurement items for privacy fatigue, which has two key dimensions -emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Data analyzed from a survey of 324 Internet users showed that privacy fatigue has a stronger impact on privacy behavior than privacy concerns do, although the latter is widely regarded as the dominant factor in explaining online privacy behavior.",0

There is nothing unique about the Holocene interglacial transition compared to past events. If you don't believe me, [look for yourself](http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/cmmap/images/learn/climate/iceages2.jpg). And the evidence for an impact is not overwhelming - many of the morphological features (spherules, shocked quartz) can be found just about anywhere at any time. Spherules in particular can be misleading as water erosion can create similar features. Shocked quartz is more convincing, but unfortunately the Earth has had many impact events and [erosion leads to mixing these impacts into normal sedimentation](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maps.12435/abstract). There is no unique elemental signature (ala Iridium) like is seen in well substantiated extinction-level impacts like the [Chicxulub Impactor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor). Typically, features associated with an impact need to be associated with an in-situ impact feature (again, like [Chicxulub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater)) to have confidence that they are not re-deposited geologic materials from another event. Because 13,000 years ago is not long geologically, almost all of our records are sedimentary in origin. And sedimentary records are from active geologic contexts where material is reworked and recycled. There are changes in some places elementally (I have measured multiple sediment cores that show changes), but this would be more easily explained by a rapid warming event that is consistent with other warming events in the Pleistocene. 

There is no unique event that demands an extraordinary explanation, and no extraordinary evidence to support it. Occam's razor applies here, particularly in context of the [known Pleistocene climatic variability](http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/cmmap/images/learn/climate/iceages2.jpg). ",0

Abstract

&gt; In human vision, the brain has to select one view of the world from our two eyes. However, the existence of a clear anatomical asymmetry providing an initial imbalance for normal neural development is still not understood. Using a so-called foveascope, we found that for a cohort of 30 normal adults, the two blue cone-free areas at the centre of the foveas are asymmetrical. The noise-stimulated afterimage dominant eye introduced here corresponds to the circular blue cone-free area, while the non-dominant eye corresponds to the diffuse and irregular elliptical outline. By contrast, we found that this asymmetry is absent or frustrated in a similar cohort of 30 adults with normal ocular status, but with dyslexia, i.e. with visual and phonological deficits. In this case, our results show that the two Maxwell centroid outlines are both circular but lead to an undetermined afterimage dominance with a coexistence of primary and mirror images. The interplay between the lack of asymmetry and the development in the neural maturation of the brain pathways suggests new implications in both fundamental and biomedical sciences.",0

Abstract:

&gt; A potentially useful approach for drug discovery is to connect gene expression profiles of disease-affected tissues (""disease signatures"") to drug signatures, but it remains to be shown whether it can be used to identify clinically relevant treatment options. We analyzed coexpression networks and genetic data to identify a disease signature for type 2 diabetes in liver tissue. By interrogating a library of 3800 drug signatures, we identified sulforaphane as a compound that may reverse the disease signature. Sulforaphane suppressed glucose production from hepatic cells by nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and decreased expression of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis. Moreover, sulforaphane reversed the disease signature in the livers from diabetic animals and attenuated exaggerated glucose production and glucose intolerance by a magnitude similar to that of metformin. Finally, sulforaphane, provided as concentrated broccoli sprout extract, reduced fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in obese patients with dysregulated type 2 diabetes.",0

&gt;Why is it every single post on this site says drilling or fracking causes earthquakes when it's the disposal of water that could be cleaned at a nominal charge, but is dumped in wastewater injection wells because it's cheaper that's causing the issue.

**Hydraulic fracturing can cause earthquakes** [[Atkinson et al., 2015](http://www.inducedseismicity.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r15_AtkinsonGhofraniAssatourians_Impact-of-Induced-Seismicity-on-the-Evaluation-of-Seismic-Hazard.pdf)]. 

The difference between fracking and wastewater injection is important, but bringing it up to ""muddy the water"" is a common tactic for those rallying on the side of industry. This was recently highlighted on /r/bestof with [this two-year old thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/31wo57/the_chevron_tapes_video_shows_oil_giant_allegedly/cq5uhse/). A quote from the Atkinson paper:

&gt;The details of the operations that induced the seismicity are just now starting to be released (information on hydraulic fracturing locations and volumes becomes public about 1 yr after the event). However, the sequence is known to have been frack induced, in part because there are no disposal wells or other plausible sources nearby and in part by the information currently available on the timing of the events in relation to hydraulic fracture operations that were taking place in the area.

It is not only deep wastewater injection that induces earthquakes. This cause was the focus of many studies, particularly with injection into the Arbuckle formation in Oklahoma. Teasing apart earthquakes caused by fracking, wastewater, and natural background seismicity is not a simple matter. It is nearly impossible without complete and transparent records of industry activities including injection volumes and pressures over time. Researchers are also aided by a long term record of seismicity in the area, not always possible in some of these sparsely instrumented regions. Bringing these factors together in multiple cases is what makes these new studies interesting and how they contribute to the greater understanding of earthquakes, both human induced and natural.

The paper originally posted above [[Magnani et al., 2017](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701593.full)] shows how researchers imaged recently active faults in northern Texas to map out how much they had moved throughout the past millions of years. Based on what they could see, these faults had not moved in the past 300 million years. The resolution of their images was limited though and motion smaller than 15 meters would not have been picked up. Factoring in this full uncertainty and assuming the fault *was* displaced 15 meters over 300 million years would mean a magnitude ~M3+ earthquake occurred on this fault roughly every 65,000 years. Considering this fault hosted five M3+ earthquake sequences in the past 10 years. odds are that this ain't natural and is instead being caused by human activity. This study is an excellent examination of an area that has been inactive for a long time prior to oil and gas production, in contrast to Oklahoma that has a great deal of natural seismicity that the more recent induced seismicity is superimposed on. Teasing apart human induced earthquakes is easier when you can rule out natural earthquakes.

Lastly, if anyone is still reading, check out this great mapping tool showing [TexNet](http://www.beg.utexas.edu/texnet/catalog). This is an earthquake monitoring network in Texas that recently came online fully, although some of the stations have been operating for many years. Detecting, locating, and sizing up earthquakes requires a dense network of quality seismic stations and will aid in understanding how earthquakes occur and whether or not we are causing them.",0

This is a general physiological response to *extreme threat* that is seen in a variety of animals. It is not a specific response to sexual assault selected into the human gene pool via rape. Comments to that effect, such as ""a woman who stays still is less likely to die and thus will have more babies"" are unscientific, post hoc, evolutionary psychological nonsense.

Abstract for convenience: 

&gt;**Background:** Cannabis is one of the most widely used psychoactive substances worldwide, but adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with its use are difficult to study because of its prohibited status in many countries.

&gt;**Objective:** Internet search engine queries have been used to investigate ADRs in pharmaceutical drugs. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested whether these queries can be used to detect the adverse reactions of cannabis use.

&gt;**Methods:** We analyzed anonymized queries from US-based users of Bing, a widely used search engine, made over a period of 6 months and compared the results with the prevalence of cannabis use as reported in the US National Survey on Drug Use in the Household (NSDUH) and with ADRs reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Drug Reporting System. Predicted prevalence of cannabis use was estimated from the fraction of people making queries about cannabis, marijuana, and 121 additional synonyms. Predicted ADRs were estimated from queries containing layperson descriptions to 195 ICD-10 symptoms list.

&gt;**Results:** Our results indicated that the predicted prevalence of cannabis use at the US census regional level reaches an R2 of .71 NSDUH data. Queries for ADRs made by people who also searched for cannabis reveal many of the known adverse effects of cannabis (eg, cough and psychotic symptoms), as well as plausible unknown reactions (eg, pyrexia).

&gt;**Conclusions:** These results indicate that search engine queries can serve as an important tool for the study of adverse reactions of illicit drugs, which are difficult to study in other settings.


And I'll copy the conclusion section of the whole paper, because it is a reasonable summary

&gt;With rising prevalence rates in recent years and a growing controversy on its health-related effects and legal status, cannabis use is widely debated in academic, legislative, and popular platforms. In light of this debate, long-term effects of cannabis use must be carefully explored. Current epidemiological research, in the form of face-to-face interviews or telephone screening, suffers from several methodological drawbacks, including, for example, limited sample size and report bias. The latter may be particularly important when exploring effects of illicit substances, as false reporting is common because of social desirability bias [29]. Our proposed method provides a novel, low-cost, and rapid method for exploring prevalence of use, characteristics of users, and underreported adverse effects of illicit drug use. To the best of our knowledge, these methods have not been reported before and may provide a particularly valuable method for studying use and effects of illicit drugs.",0

"725",734,"Empathy is a complex state. For example, [people might want to read this abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18573266)

&gt;  (MRI studies on children showed that) the perception of other people in pain was associated with increased haemodynamic activity in the neural circuits involved in the processing of first-hand experience of pain [...] Interestingly, when watching one person inflicting pain onto another, regions that are consistently engaged in representing social interaction.

[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277363/) shows that further,  we can switch on and off our empathy at will. 

[Wai and Tiliopoulos](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bc5e/c57b79223f0ff2c11136b6c01ec52e3f2c22.pdf) distinguish two types of empathy: cognitive empathy and affective empathy. Cognitive empathy involves the ability to understand the emotional states of others, but without sharing in those feelings. By contrast, when affective empathy is felt it manifests as sharing in others' emotions. Individuals with high-functioning autism are impaired in cognitive empathy, but have normal affective responses. Narcissists - the 'dark triad' of the paper cited - have strong cognitive empathy - they can read and manipulate other peoples' emotional states - but they do not share in those states. 

Now, one can deconstruct the word ""prejudice"" in a similar manner. We have long learned to think in terms of human groups, classes and types. This is generally very helpful - *he's a customer, she's staff"" - but it can indeed have its negatives if used without context. At war, the sight of an enemy uniform arouses a very useful form of prejudice. However, if they have surrendered to us, then we need a different set of reflexes. Children are generally irresponsible, but we surrender to blind prejudice if we act as though all children are always and everywhere incapable of structured behaviour. 

Our world works through approximations. We get rough insight through empathy, and rough guidance through affective empathy. We get equally vague but useful directions from thinking in terms f human categories, but it si helpoful to realise that there are many such categories and the rules in one are broken in another. Combining both approximations generally offers better guidance that relying on the one or the other. ",0

This is means you would have to treat 67 people in order to prevent one episode of CV death OR MI OR stroke OR hospitalization for unstable angina OR coronary revascularization (heart cath).  This is an extremely soft endpoint.  The secondary endpoint, which is more useful though not great, also demonstrates absolute risk reduction of 1.5% and number needed to treat of 67.  

While the study may have been underpowered, the study drug had no significant effect on CV mortality, which is the most important endpoint.  This is an important consideration when this monoclonal antibody is estimated to cost $11,000-$14,000 per patient per year.  The manuscript states the effect size increased beyond the first year of therapy to 19% relative risk reduction (2.3% absolute risk reduction).  This means you would have to treat 44 people for over 1 year ($484,000-$616,000) in order to prevent 1 episode of primary endpoint.  When the primary endpoint includes hospitalization for unstable angina, you have to ask whether this is overall beneficial.  This benefit analysis is further qualified by the fact that coronary revascularization has not been shown to reduce mortality in unstable angina or non-ST elevated MI.

&amp;nbsp;


Paleontologist here,

I'd just like to say a few things based on the comments I'm seeing here: 

&amp;nbsp;

First off, my qualifications: My current advisor is the third author on this paper and I worked under (and collaborated with) the second author when I worked at the San Diego Natural History Museum (in fact, I re-prepared some of the material in this paper about 6 years ago). Furthermore, I am a doctoral student in the final months (hopefully) of my PhD. My dissertation work has been on proboscideans (elephants and their relatives), but I have also done a fair amount of work on cetaceans (whales) and other vertebrates.

&amp;nbsp;

As far as the dating methods go, this site was dated using multiple types of absolute dating methods, which all resulted in a very similar age. However, the Uranium-series dating (not to be confused with radiocarbon dating, which could not give you an accurate age this old) that was used here got results with a *very* high confidence. In fact there is essentially no evidence of alteration that might lead to an older date (which really would not be common anyways). The dates recovered are almost unimpeachable (and I don't say that lightly). I would be very surprised if a geochronologist or any other expert had a major problems with the dates themselves (in fact a geochronologist was a reviewer for this paper for just this reason). Also, to the people that are saying that it is perhaps time to reassess our methods of isotopic dating in general, I strongly suggest you spend more time researching and trying to understand these methods before you make a claim like this...

&amp;nbsp;

One other misconception that I keep seeing here are peoples' interpretation of what is meant by ""human"" in this paper. ""Human"" is meant here in the sense of a species of the genus *Homo*, not necessarily *Homo sapiens* specifically. In fact, because of the old age it seems fairly unlikely that this would be the modern species of human rather than some other [unknown] species.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sure there will be other questions or comments here throughout the next day or so, and I will try to check in from time to time and update this post. I'm also happy to answer any questions that I can (to the best of my knowledge).

&amp;nbsp;

Hope this is at least somewhat helpful!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit 1: To the folks wondering if this site could have been scavenged by humans (as opposed to hunted), I would say that, that is absolutely possible. In fact there is really no evidence one way or another to argue for hunting over scavenging at this site, and I don't believe that this paper takes a stance on this either. In fact, I would say that the argument of hunting vs scavenging in association with this mastodon is somewhat irrelevant. What is important is that this extremely old site (relatively speaking, anyways) has fairly clear association with ancient human activity. 

&amp;nbsp;

Edit 2: Several people have pointed out that the article discusses a lack of evidence of meat stripping on the specimen. This does suggest scavenging, as it likely means the soft tissue was at least somewhat rotted and not usable. 

&amp;nbsp;

Edit 3: Many people are suggesting that this animal could have been scavenged or had its bones modified many thousands of years after its death (i.e., implying the tools are much younger than the mastodon). To that point 1) the type of breakage seen on these bones is indicative of damage while the bone was still fresh. Fresh bone (sometimes called ""green bone"") breaks in a very different ""spiral pattern"" than older dried out bone; and 2) you have to remember that the sediments that the tools and mastodon are found in represent the context in which they were buried. Therefore since these materials were all found within the same layer they must have been buried at the same time. It is possible that ancient humans exhumed old bones (though I know of no actual evidence of this), **but** we would see telltale signs of disturbance to the sediment (which was not observed here). 


In other words, I don't think that arguments about this site will come down to whether the material is associated and coeval, but whether folks think that these artifacts are indeed stone tools. Those people who do not agree with this identification will then have to reconcile the crazy taphonomy at this site and attribute it to some other natural process (which will be no small feat, IMHO).

&amp;nbsp;

Edit 4: For the people asking why we don't have any evidence of humans (or human remains) in North America in the time between the age of this site and more generally accepted dates:


First off, I would just like to note that we are almost certainly not talking about a direct lineage of humans between the time of this site and those of Clovis times (in fact, as I've stated above, we are likely not even talking about the same species). This was likely a very small population of humans that made it to North America that probably died out long before the modern species of human ever made it over. In that sense, there isn't necessarily a gap of time to ""bridge"".


As for why potential sites might not be preserved: There are a couple of reasons that you might not have evidence of humans found from this time. First off, you may not have rocks of the right age readily exposed in the region where the individuals were living (which is somewhat the case on the west coast, as far as I am aware). Second, the individuals could be living in an environment that is not conducive to preserving fossils (e.g., organisms that live in montane environments tend to not preserve in the fossil record because sediments are not being deposited in those regions). Third, getting preserved in the fossil record (in general) is very rare, and if your study organism has a very small population size or is short lived (as we would expect in the case here) then you have a very very low probability of being preserved (let alone found and collected). Finally, even if these scenarios aren't the case, there is the possibility that scientists have just been looking in the wrong strata, region, or age.",0

I don't drink much (an average of 1 drink per year), but I've occasionally dated women who will go to a bar or night club once every month or so, even when they're in a relationship. They've always said they're just having a girls' night out and it's nothing to worry about.

There's a part of me that, on an instinctual and unscientific level, feels uncomfortable with that, but because I want to be a good partner, I've spent a lot of time considering the hypothesis that I have an exaggerated view of how people conduct themselves when they're drinking due to lack of experience. Accordingly, I spent time going to bars and clubs myself to scope it out and see how people act, and what I found is that the constant drunken cheating-fest portrayed in movies and on TV isn't accurate.

Also, to add weight to the ""drinking and clubbing by yourself while you're in a relationship is okay"" argument, the psychologist Dr. Caryl Rusbult thoroughly investigated the causes of cheating and found that people cheat precisely when they compare their relationship to other alternative relationships (real or imagined) and find their relationship lacking (which she calls the CL-ALT metric). So, if your relationship with your partner is strong and positive, you probably don't need to worry about your partner cheating.

This study adds an interesting counterpoint to that, and it's causing me to reconsider what I feel is advisable behavior for people in relationships.

I'm curious what other people think and whether anyone has any scientific data to back it up: what is the relationship between alcohol consumption in bars/clubs and cheating?",0

&gt; Astronomers find a galaxy unchanged since the early universe


&gt; Researchers at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) confirm the first detection of a relic galaxy with the Hubble Space Telescope. The results of this research are published today in Nature magazine.


&gt;There is a calculation suggesting that only one in a thousand massive galaxies is a relic of the early universe, conserving intact the properties it had when it was formed thousands of millions of years ago.

A single population of red globular clusters around the massive compact galaxy NGC 1277.

Abstract

Massive galaxies are thought to form in two phases: an initial collapse of gas and giant burst of central star formation, followed by the later accretion of material that builds up their stellar and dark-matter haloes1,2,3,4. The systems of globular clusters within such galaxies are believed to form in a similar manner. The initial central burst forms metal-rich (spectrally red) clusters, whereas more metal-poor (spectrally blue) clusters are brought in by the later accretion of less-massive satellites5,6,7,8,9,10. This formation process is thought to result in the multimodal optical colour distributions that are seen in the globular cluster systems of massive galaxies8,11,12. Here we report optical observations of the massive relic-galaxy candidate NGC 1277-a nearby, un-evolved example of a high-redshift 'red nugget' galaxy13,14,15,16,17. We find that the optical colour distribution of the cluster system of NGC 1277 is unimodal and entirely red. This finding is in strong contrast to other galaxies of similar and larger stellar mass, the cluster systems of which always exhibit (and are generally dominated by) blue clusters11. We argue that the colour distribution of the cluster system of NGC 1277 indicates that the galaxy has undergone little (if any) mass accretion after its initial collapse, and use simulations of possible merger histories to show that the stellar mass due to accretion is probably at most ten per cent of the total stellar mass of the galaxy. These results confirm that NGC 1277 is a genuine relic galaxy and demonstrate that blue clusters constitute an accreted population in present-day massive galaxies.

"965",975,"&gt;&gt; Using what researchers already know about ancient hominin population sizes, migration patterns, and the way ecology works, Kolodny and Feldman built a simple computer model that would simulate Neanderthal and Homo sapiens interactions in Paleolithic Europe. At the start of the simulation, Europe is inhabited by ""bands"" of Neanderthals that randomly move around and die out. Every so often, a band of modern humans migrates out of Africa and joins the European fray. Bands from each species have equal likelihoods of displacing the other - neither one had an advantage from a natural selection perspective.

The idea that humans were not smarter than neanderthals is just an assumption built into a computer simulation. The argument in the paper is that we do not need to show that humans were smarter than neanderthals to explain humanity's displacement of the neanderthals. The migratory pressure of humans gradually coming from Africa and the Middle East is enough to account for the displacement. ",0

"16289",16532,"This study was mainly concerned with assessing how stigma can transfer across different identities - i.e., can people feel stigmatized when they encounter prejudices about groups they do not belong to?

The reasoning behind the researchers' hypothesis is this:

&gt;Research on the characteristics of prejudiced people suggests that prejudice does indeed have monolithic characteristics; people who hold racist beliefs also hold sexist beliefs, and vice versa... The monolithic aspects of sexism and racism are explained in part by the tendency for prejudiced individuals to show preference for in-group dominance and social inequalities, termed a **social dominance orientation**. In fact, social dominance orientation is more strongly linked to sexism and anti-Black attitudes than other prejudiced-related personality traits and ideologies.

So essentially, prejudice towards specific groups can be understood as a general outlook on the world (SDO), which predicts prejudice towards other groups as well. The researchers were interested in whether laypeople were aware of this correlation, and whether that awareness affected how they felt when facing prejudice towards groups that they did not belong to.

To test this, the researchers conducted 5 studies: the first 2 were MTurk studies involving hypothetical situations, first with White women and White men being presented with sexist, racist, and control profiles. Both men and women were rated the sexist and racist conditions as less ""likable,"" and rated them as more likely to have SDO orientation. However, White women were more likely to perceive racism than were the White men in the study.

The second study was a similarly-set up MTurk study, but with Black and Latino men as the focus instead of White women. It found similar results - *all* participants found the sexist profile to be more racist, but (as expected), men of color were more likely to anticipate experiencing racial stigma from the sexist profile.

The third study also involved MTurk, but rather than hypothetical situations, it involved interactions in a chatroom. The fourth study set out to replicate the findings of the first 3 studies in a laboratory setting. The fifth study set out to examine whether there were order effects in the previous studies.

One additional thing that was interesting that the researchers found, was that stigmatized groups are fairly logical in their assessment of whether someone will be prejudiced against them:

&gt;Moreover, stigma transfer occurred because people have a lay understanding of the **monolithic qualities of prejudice**, namely, they perceive racists and sexists as having a greater social dominance orientation than other people.

&gt;These results suggest that stigmatized group members may operate in a rational manner to determine the likelihood that evaluators will treat them unfairly. That is, research suggests that it might be accurate to assume that racist evaluators have a higher likelihood of being sexist compared with nonracist evaluators (Kteily, Ho, &amp; Sidanius, 2012). In addition, White women were most likely to see themselves at risk for stigmatization when evaluators held sexist beliefs and then, to a lesser degree, when they held negative out-group attitudes in a context in which they could arguably encounter similar stereotypes and challenges. **This suggests that participants were applying appropriately different weight to the ambiguous cue (out-group prejudice) and the blatant cue (in-group prejudice) when determining identity threat.**",0

Abstract

&gt; Organismal complexity broadly relates to the number of different cell types within an organism and generally increases across a phylogeny. Whilst gene expression will underpin organismal complexity, it has long been clear that a simple count of gene number is not a sufficient explanation. In this paper, we use open-access information from the Ensembl databases to quantify the functional diversity of human genes that are broadly involved in transcription. Functional diversity is described in terms of the numbers of paralogues, protein isoforms and structural domains for each gene. The change in functional diversity is then calculated for up to nine orthologues from the nematode worm to human and correlated to the change in cell-type number. Those with the highest correlation are subject to gene ontology term enrichment and interaction analyses. We found that a range of genes that encode proteins associated with dynamic changes to chromatin are good candidates to contribute to organismal complexity.

Abstract: 

&gt; Epic tales of existential catastrophe have been written down for thousands of years, and in Christian traditions were linked to the punishment of humanity for its sins. We are still imagining new storylines for the end-of-civilization, with a rich genre of Hollywood films depicting either the struggles of remnant humans in a post-apocalyptic world, or some event that threatens the very survival of our species. Instead of a spiritual reckoning imposed by God, Hollywood's Armageddon is usually the result of technology run amok, or mindless industrialization and population growth causing an environmental collapse. While dramatization of an environmental Armageddon might seem fanciful, existential risk warrants serious consideration even though the probability of an apocalypse is vanishingly small. If we are to avoid the unthinkable and unimaginable, then we need to ask what might be the most plausible pathways to an environmental apocalypse? We review the major environmental concepts pertinent to apocalyptic events, and conclude that positive feedback loops and multiplicative stresses represent the gravest existential risks, and the risks society is least likely to foresee. Zombies created by a misbegotten genetically engineered virus might make for a great movie, but it is the hubris of technical experts who are blind to surprising interaction networks, or who are unaware of positive feedback loops that will be our undoing.",0

**Abstract**

&gt; Musical training confers advantages in speech-sound processing, which could play an important role in early childhood education. To understand the mechanisms of this effect, we used event-related potential and behavioral measures in a longitudinal design. Seventy-four Mandarin-speaking children aged 4-5 y old were pseudorandomly assigned to piano training, reading training, or a no-contact control group. Six months of piano training improved behavioral auditory word discrimination in general as well as word discrimination based on vowels compared with the controls. The reading group yielded similar trends. However, the piano group demonstrated unique advantages over the reading and control groups in consonant-based word discrimination and in enhanced positive mismatch responses (pMMRs) to lexical tone and musical pitch changes. The improved word discrimination based on consonants correlated with the enhancements in musical pitch pMMRs among the children in the piano group. In contrast, all three groups improved equally on general cognitive measures, including tests of IQ, working memory, and attention. The results suggest strengthened common sound processing across domains as an important mechanism underlying the benefits of musical training on language processing. In addition, although we failed to find far-transfer effects of musical training to general cognition, the near-transfer effects to speech perception establish the potential for musical training to help children improve their language skills. Piano training was not inferior to reading training on direct tests of language function, and it even seemed superior to reading training in enhancing consonant discrimination.",0

GOOD information about nutrition is more ubiquitous now, and markets are starting to shift to offer healthier options, even if those bad ones still exist.

Vegetables are becoming fads. Look at how popular Kale was, or the wild popularity of Avocados (Which are fruit, but whatever). 

Combine that with the popularity of cooking, which gets people off the wartime calorie-is-king mindset toward cooking we saw during the mid 90's, and you have people who are again, more aware of options and less adapted to unhealthy carb-loaded foods that a lot of people grew up with.

Eating healthier foods isn't relegated to yuppies and hippies anymore. Look at pro Athletes. They often have strict diets nowadays and champion healthy eating.

There's actually a *very* strong argument in favor of its use in prosthetics, and I'm a little surprised we haven't gone this route yet.

From the study:

&gt; We recently reported that para-aramid, commonly known as Kevlar, can form a nanofibrous dispersion in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Solution-processable nanoscale versions of Kevlar, i.e., aramid nanofibers (ANFs), retain the high mechanical properties of their macroscale parent, and these materials have served as the building blocks for high-strength flexible conductors and battery separators. In the context of this study, a key fact is that ANFs with diameters of 5-30 nm and lengths of 3-10 µm form networked structures when DMSO is exchanged with water. Their structural similarity to biological nanofibers, such as those from collagen and those that display extensive branching, inspired us to explore ANFs as the stiff components of biomimetic composites. Simultaneously, they offer the possibility of noncovalent interactions with soft polymers. The adaptive interplay between stiff and soft components may lead to synergistic stiffening and toughening.",0

&gt;'Worryingly there is evidence that parents may be underestimating their daughters' mental health needs,' she added. 'Conversely, parents may be picking up on symptoms in their sons, which boys don't report themselves. It's vital that both children and their parents can make their voices heard to maximise the chances of early identification and access to specialist support.'

While the *survey* study makes some interesting findings, these types of conclusions make me quite skeptical especially in light of the fact that these are not clinical diagnosis for depression, but rather self-reported survey responses.  

The claim that parents are better able to identify depressive symptoms in boys and underestimate them in girls does not seem to causally follow the results of a survey, even though it is multi-year (over a decade) for two main reasons.  

One, a clinical diagnosis involves blood work to test for a bevy of diseases that are known to contribute to depression, in addition to the interviews.  Also, the symptoms of depression are often confounded by the symptoms of other diseases, poor lifestyle choices, etc.

Secondly, the article neglects to mention one key aspect that is different in girls than boys, and it is the fact that girls undergo puberty earlier than boys, and so far the study has only published the 2012 Age 11 findings.  Yet the scientist in the article is making a blanket statement speculating the difference between depression rates in girls (25%) and boys (10%) up to the age of 11 is primarily due to how parents treat either sex while completely neglecting the onset of puberty?

It is still a great study in terms of sample size and data collection, but let's let the Age 14 data be reviewed and published before jumping to conclusions just yet.",0

Many research questions, such as how misinformed users judge potential rumors or how they respond to them, are crucial issues for crisis communication, but have not been extensively studied. This paper fills this gap by originally documenting and studying Twitter users' rumor and debunking response behaviors during disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. To this end, two rumors from each disaster and their related tweets are documented for analysis. Users who were misinformed and involved in the rumor topic by posting tweet(s), could respond to a rumor by: (1) spreading (85.86-91.40%), (2) confirmation-seeking (5.39-9.37%), or (3) doubting (0.71-8.75%). However, if the rumor-spreading users were debunked, they would respond by: (1) deleting rumor tweet(s) (2.94-10.00%), (2) clarifying rumor information with a new tweet (0-19.75%), or (3) neither deleting nor clarifying (78.13-97.06%). We conclude that Twitter users perform poorly in rumor detection and rush to spread rumors. The majority of users who spread rumors do not take further action on their Twitter accounts to fix their rumor-spreading behaviors.",0

&gt; The approximate distribution in the Universe is 5% regular matter, 25% Dark Matter, and 70% Dark Energy. Half of that 5% was missing, and now found.

&gt; Regular matter makes stars and visible galaxies, so it is ""bright"". Dark Matter is so named because it does not make things we can see with telescopes directly - it is ""dark"". We can see the effects it makes with gravity, such as the rotation curves of galaxies, and gravitational lensing. So we know something is there, just not what it is made of. Dark Energy was invented to solve a couple of mysteries. One is the geometrical ""flatness"" of the Universe, and the other is the apparent acceleration of the Universe's expansion. Like Dark Matter, we don't yet know what it is. But something is causing the flatness and acceleration, so we gave it a name as a place-holder for theories.

&gt; A similar situation happened a century ago, with the precession (shift) of Mercury's orbit with time. We thought it was caused by a planet inside of Mercury's orbit that we hadn't found yet. It was named Vulcan, after the Roman god of fire (not Spock's home planet). It turns out relativity was the right answer - the Suns gravity bends space near it, and causes the orbit to shift. Vulcan was just ""a name we gave to whatever causes the observed effect"".

&gt; Dark Matter and Dark Energy could turn out to be something entirely different than types of matter and energy, but in the mean time it gives them names we can attach theories about them to.

First, mental health can be affected by numerous things such as stress, anxiety, memory loss, fear, feeling isolated, etc... and it appears that they failed to label what aspect of mental health they were looking at. Second, it makes a leap from depression and concludes that abortion doesn't cause depression, so that means there's no harm to mental health. My third issue is they didn't define the timeline (i.e. short vs long term mental health). They also didn't outline how long they followed these women for. 

I'm all for dispelling myths but it seems they determined ""no immediate depressive type symptoms appeared in women who had abortions"" and then conclude there are no mental health issues to worry about. So you mean to tell me not a single woman you followed was stressed, worried, having anxiety, or had any fear before the procedure or had any negative feelings afterwards that may have been affecting their short term mental health?

The half life of PFOA and PFOS in the environment is 1,000,000 years. It will never leave the drinking water. What happens now is that they filter the water at the well sites and then each home has a carbon filter on their incoming water supply. Multiple forms of cancer are caused by this 'surfactant' or soap. I've seen the 10+ hours of video that Wilbur Tennant filmed when they dumped this poison into Dry Run Creek. Cows completely deformed, internal organs turned to mush, calfs born blind and deformed. You can't make this stuff up. The videos will haunt me till I die. Despite the settlement DuPont (now Chemours) never took responsibility and will never. And now with President Agent Orange in office, there's no stopping them from dumping other chemicals into the Ohio. Fun fact, one of DuPont's defenses was that the Ohio is the 4th most polluted river in America, so how does anyone know it was their chemical that cause kidney and testicular cancer. The juries physically recoiled at this statement/defense. Another awesome fact, is that once they realized it was getting into the blood of their workers, Tony Playtis, their plant medical supervisor, helped them raise the smoke stacks so that they intentionally dispersed C8 to the community, to protect their workers. They knew it was floating across the river and landing on the well fields of Little Hocking, Belpre, all 5 of the water districts there, and they were PROUD of it since the levels in their workers went down. They even told the public it wasn't bad for them. It's Erin Brockovich style on a much larger scale. Oh and one more awesome fact, there are 70,000 unregulated chemicals just like C8 that are dumped into rivers and the atmosphere across the county. Seventy THOUSAND. But hey, they are massive Trump supporters and will be poisoned again, and they're generally too uneducated to make the connection.

"2519",2547,"Hello Drs. Blackburn and Epel, and thank you for doing this AMA.

The big questions in aging research are typically: 1) *why do we age?* and 2) *can we do anything about it?*

In this context, I have always had a hard time getting too excited about telomeres.

In humans, multiple studies have tried to link telomere length to aging, mortality and other similar outcomes. While some studies have found minor associations, [many have not](http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/66A/2/202/T1.expansion.html). Similarly, telomere length at birth varies dramatically across haplotypes, without any seemingly strong association to longevity. You and others have described how a variety of environmental and genetic insults an lead to telomere shortening, but these very same insults often wreak havoc on other pathways commonly associated with aging as well (metabolism, circadian rhythm etc.).

And when it comes to ""targeting"" telomere length, I think the evidence and biological rationale that this may work is equally equivocal. While some animal models have shown that telomerase activation (gene therapy, transgenics etc.) can extend lifespan, it is unclear that this has any translational path forward. There just seem to be too many questions about how to do it: gene therapy with an oncogene (the telomerase subunits) is likely to scare clinicians, what would the endpoints of any such clinical trial be, what cell types have to be transduced and at what efficiency to see a benefit etc. Similarly, telomerase inhibitors (i.e. Imetelstat) have really struggled to put up results in the clinic.

So with all of this in mind, I'd love to return to those first two questions (why do we age and what can we do about it):

- In the next ten years, what are the critical experiments and readouts that you would want to see to be able to say that telomere shortening is a key driver of normal aging in humans?

- If you think that telomere shortening is a key driver of aging, do you think there is a path forward for therapeutically slowing or reversing the process in humans?

The assumption that our more direct ancestors ""won"" based on some evolutionary advantage doesn't appear to have much evidence behind it. Neanderthals went from being depicted as beastmen to resembling people I might see on a daily basis. It seems like we've been making egocentric assumptions from the start.

Just different.

Then there is the bit where the researcher compared the ancient bones to the arm bones of rowers. As someone else stated, rowers legs do most of the work. You should have heard the researcher as she explained that rowers practice 20 hours a WEEK, and was then amazed that the ancient women had stronger bones. 20 hours a week is 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. Anyone who thinks ancient women stopped grinding grain after their 4-hour shift was over and took the weekends off: raise your hand.

They expose the patient to about as much background radiation as they would normally experience in every day life (walking around outside with some sun exposure) for ten days.  They yield a lower sensitivity in identifying pathology however as they are lower definition and only give one shot of a 2D image.  For example, you may see the descending colon but you are seeing all of it at once blurred together, so specific findings such as diverticulosis (herniated outpouchings of bowel) vs acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (inflammation and infection of these outpouchings) would be difficult to differentiate.  

Abdominal CT yields a much higher resolution of images.  Pathology is much clearer to the viewer and images come in slices, so I can see frontal slices of your abdomen in say 10mm sections.  I can also see the same abdomen but in horizontal descending slices.  Between the multiple views, I can focus in on only the discrete pathology that I wish to look for and can diagnose abdominal disease with a much higher degree of sensitivity (""accuracy"").  The cost however is that in order to achieve this, the test exposes the patient to more radiation than x rays.  A CT scan exposes the patient to about 2.5 years of background radiation.  We often consider the rule of threes here as well.  If you are under 30, you are three times more likely to develop cancer from the radiation than your average person because you are young and in the course of your long life expectancy, there is more time for a malignancy to develop.  If you are over 60, you are three times less likely to develop cancer than your average person because you don't have as much life expectancy remaining as the average person and likely won't be around long enough to develop a malignancy.  Simply put, if a young child has abdominal pain, we try everything we can to make the diagnosis with ultrasound or other diagnostics because we don't want to expose them to a more significant chance of developing cancer from the CT radiation.  By contrast, pretty much every nursing home patient who shows up to the ED who can't give an informed history as to what has happened or what they are feeling during our exam, gets a CT without hesitation.  

However, you can't use the term x ray and CT interchangeably especially when talking about radiation exposure since there is more radiation from one CT than from ninety x rays.  ",0

I recently moved to a different state due to losing my job. I am currently unemployed and haven't made any friends. I am alone most of the time. My family doesn't have an idea of how severe my depression is because it's very embarrassing for me to talk about.

I try to tell myself that I HAVE to do this bc nobody will do it for me and I'm the only one that can change my situation. But it seems when I start doing it I get very frustrsted at simple things, like if I don't understand a certain process or if my computer messes up filling out a long application.

http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/VoterIDLawsSuppressionofMinorityVoters.pdf

The study is almost comically bad.  They were looking for voter suppression:

""Although there are many reasons to suspect that these laws could
harm groups like racial minorities and the poor, existing studies have generally failed to demonstrate a link between voter ID laws and voter turnout among these groups. We question these null effects. We argue that because most of the studies occurred before states enacted strict identification requirements, they uncover few effects. ""

So, they proceed to look until they find this.  (Well, not for the poor.  They don't attempt to look for this.  Only for race.)

They use an online survey to identify their subjects, without validating who these people are, or that they were eligible to vote in the first place:

""To assess the impact of voter identification laws on turnout, we utilize data from the 2006-2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies (CCES). The CCES is a national stratified sample survey administered over the internet of over 50,000 respondents by YouGov/Polimetrix. The CCES is the ideal tool for examining voter identification laws for three reasons. ""

Then they find this:

""In both cases, there is no apparent relationship between strict ID laws and overall voter turnout. Net other factors, whether or not a state requires identification to cast a standard ballot has no significant effect on the likelihood of any individual voting. This holds true regardless of how we measure voter identification laws or which other factors we include in our regression model. That conclusion is hardly surprising given that it fits with the bulk of existing studies.""

They find this, in fact:

""For Blacks, the gap is negligible in general elections ""

That's inconvenient.

""The effects are perhaps most consistent for Latinos""

&gt; Mammals that possess elaborate antipredator defences such as body armour, spines and quills are usually well protected, intermediate in size, primarily insectivorous and live in simple open environments. The benefits of such defences seem clear and may relax selection on maintaining cognitive abilities that aid in vigilance and predator recognition, and their bearers may accrue extensive production and maintenance costs. Here, in this comparative phylogenetic analysis of measurements of encephalization quotient and morphological defence scores of 647 mammal species representing nearly every order, we found that as lineages evolve stronger defences, they suffer a correlated reduction in encephalization. The only exceptions were those that live in trees-a complex three-dimensional world probably requiring greater cognitive abilities. At the proximate level, because brain tissue is extremely energetically expensive to build, mammals may be trading off spending more on elaborate defences and saving by building less powerful brains. **At the ultimate level, having greater defences may also reduce the need for advanced cognitive abilities for constant assessment of environmental predation risk, especially in simple open environments.**",0

We function mainly as claims auditors ensuring hospitals are paid according to contractual agreement. All costs are maintained via a hospital charge master or CDM. The charges on the CDM are greatly marked up. But that's because the costs inherently include the expense of hospital operation. That means gas, electricity, water, insurance, biohazard waste disposal, salaries the whole works (after all who else would the hospital charge for this stuff?) On top of that, it's inflated again as the charge master is primarily used as a bargaining point for insurance companies. The insurance company wants to get the largest discount possible from the CDM. In exchange for the sweet discount, the insurance company will funnel all of their subscribers to your hospital. Basically discount= patient volume. But that CDM is static for everyone. So insurance or no, that's still the cost of getting an asprin. This article is misleading because they're alluding that hospitals are being malicious and taking advantage of patients. The truth is much more complicated. Higher number of uninsured means higher number of non payments which means higher mark up to offset the expense. This doesn't even touch the fact that hospital administrative costs make up close to half of the expense. Every insurance company reimburses differently and it's up to the hospital to reconcile. US Healthcare is a total clustercuss that a one payer system seems like a clear win. But would a billion dollar insurance company just fold overnight?

Abstract:

&gt; Stocks of virgin-mined materials utilized in linear economic flows continue to present enormous challenges. E-waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams, and threatens to grow into a global problem of unmanageable proportions. An effective form of management of resource recycling and environmental improvement is available, in the form of extraction and purification of precious metals taken from waste streams, in a process known as urban mining. In this work, we demonstrate utilizing real cost data from e-waste processors in China that ingots of pure copper and gold could be recovered from e-waste streams at costs that are comparable to those encountered in virgin mining of ores. Our results are confined to the cases of copper and gold extracted and processed from e-waste streams made up of recycled TV sets, but these results indicate a trend and potential if applied across a broader range of e-waste sources and metals extracted. If these results can be extended to other metals and countries, they promise to have positive impact on waste disposal and mining activities globally, as the circular economy comes to displace linear economic pathways.",0

While the authors don't cite this, one reason why this is such an interesting result is that there's been a good deal of work that shows a gender difference in sleep cycle efficiency; women tend to get more slow wave sleep and REM than men of the same age do.  (Looking at the study, their small sample of women did, in fact, get more SWS.)

It's been thought that may be an evolutionary adaption due to childrearing; women tend to make do with less sleep in general at that stage in their lives, and so efficiency over the long term becomes paramount.  That doesn't get disproven here by any means, but this does throw an interesting wrinkle into the equation; under the much rarer condition of complete sleep deprivation which was set up here (versus intermittent sleep, much more common in the real world as any new parent would recognize), men seemed to perform better on one of the tasks that's been directly correlated with an impairment to memory consolidation.

On the other hand, as many of the commenters have noted, you can come up with all sorts of theses about why this took place.  I'll be curious to see the several followup studies, and do hope we also see what a PSG of t+1 looks like, where I'd hypothesize we'd see even more massive spikes in efficiency for women over men during a recovery phase.",0

Abstract

The distance individuals maintain between themselves and others can be defined as 'interpersonal space'. This distance can be modulated both by situational factors and individual characteristics. Here we investigated the influence that the interpretation of other people interaction, in which one is not directly involved, may have on a person's interpersonal space. In the current study we measured, for the first time, whether the size of interpersonal space changes after listening to other people conversations with neutral or aggressive content. The results showed that the interpersonal space expands after listening to a conversation with aggressive content relative to a conversation with a neutral content. This finding suggests that participants tend to distance themselves from an aggressive confrontation even if they are not involved in it. These results are in line with the view of the interpersonal space as a safety zone surrounding one's body.

"14516",14727,"I think it's important to note that even if a group has an agenda, that doesn't mean they can't be right about a topic (global warming advocates would come to mind). Just because a media source is more popular and has a longer standing reputation doesn't mean they aren't susceptible to corruption or bias (such as NPR). We've all seen some seriously sketchy articles get published in Nature with sample sizes of around 12, and that's widely regarded as a good source in the science community. 

Looking at sources and seeing if the conclusions drawn make sense is necessary for critical thinking. However, that takes a good deal of time, and sometimes we defer to ""experts"". for example: I like to ride bikes and need a new set of tires. I certainly can't buy all the tires and test them. And every company has there own test regiment that makes their tire look the best. Even professional racers have sponsors, so their word is not without bias. Magazines are just long winded ads. So I am left with the community opinion. Is the hive mind my best source? Or have companies started to plant PR personalities in the forums? There is no good solution, and eventually I need to buy new tires...

Trusting credible experts is a good start, but they can be wrong and have their own bias. Without a solid understanding of statistics the general population will be difficult to convince of certain phenomena, and even then there are arguments about sampling biases (just look at the sexual harassment in college debate). Some experiments are unethical, and so we are left to the interpretation of data with no way to verify theories. Verifying the source of a picture is easy enough, as long as you trust google or microsoft. But, some topics are beyond me and I don't have the background to verify it.",0

That said, the NJ law requiring all handguns sold in the state to be smart guns as soon as the technology is commercially available is a good example of a political strategy to make guns more expensive and less available in the state.  Most gun owners I know who rely on a firearm for self-defense would not be willing to rely on a new biometric technology to use a firearm that they may need instantly.  I use biometrics for some safes and my phone now, and it's fine, but it routinely fails to unlock if I don't perfectly align my finger, or if my finger is wet, or if I am wearing gloves, or if there is dirt or debris or lint on the sensor, etc.  Not a big deal for my phone, but that would be a problem for a gun that I might need immediately.  I'd say that once the technology is advanced and refined enough that the police all use it, then it would be reasonable to expect citizens to trust it with their lives as well.  Forcing citizens to be the Guinea pigs for a technology that is unproven and that no police are willing to trust, that is very expensive to implement, and that is only available on extremely few gun models, seems more like an anti-gun tactic than a legitimate effort to move the firearm industry toward safer practices.",0

"19115",19405,"I'm not a scientist but I did some research of the existing literature a few months back, and for those curious a concept in computer science and social science is that of *trust* and how it propagates in [social graphs like this](https://www.iloveseo.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Example-of-social-network-graph-in-maps-by-linkedin.gif). Basically there are many different models that try to explain how much trust you are willing to give a friend of a friend, and then a friend of a friend of a friend, etc. Generally speaking the closer someone is to you in the graph the more trust you give them.

Another interesting concept is that democracy requires *generalized* trust in the social institutions, so that while you may not trust the other *people* around you very much, as long as you trust the *system* then you are more likely to vote and act in ways that bring about a more democratic society. If you don't trust the system then you will tend to disengage, resulting in concentration of power that brings about the very broken system you were trying to disengage from. Because by disengaging you are reducing the connections between you/your group and the wider network, so ideas/values/capital/etc are much slower to travel to/from your group. This aligns with some of the sociological theories that increasing intergroup interactions can break down these cliques by fostering more intergroup connections, but you also have issues of status/etc that come into play and make that a more complex issue as well.

Small Worlds effectively form what are called *strongly connected components* in the larger social graph. Think of it like a *clique*. (for example see the highlighted clusters in [this image](https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1378/5151742603_0c0134107b_b.jpg)) The number of ""hops"" between you and others in this group become much smaller (because ""everyone knows everyone else"") so your trust goes much higher as everyone is now ""closer"" to you in that group. And as people in the group ""disconnect"" from the wider social network, if you are inside the clique then it can take more and more ""hops"" to get from you to anyone outside the clique, so your trust in them and their info goes down further. This is how groups can become more and more isolated over time, and those who maintain contact with the rest of the network can act as gatekeepers and gain power and control.

Based on this it seems pretty straightforward that the anti-vaxx movement is resistant to change because members are more likely to believe those in their own group over those outside their own group. Thus they live in a self-referential bubble. Since they are surrounded by those with similar views they are validated constantly in holding firm to their beliefs, even when presented with evidence to the contrary by ""outsiders"" -- and if anyone on the ""inside"" changes their mind it is easier to cast them out as a ""heretic"" than it is to accept a different point of view, again because the rest of the voices in the group are in agreement. So you have social pressure to conform, and have to choose whether or not you will choose to identify with your ingroup and turn away from the new info, or accept the possibility of new info and end up being cast out by your friends who have helped you form your core identity for years.

Every person with a chronic illness who doesn't take medications they need is a person who will be dead or disabled early.  

Even if you approach this as a psychopath with no empathy, rationally it is nonsensical to allow workers to die or become dependent on disability assistance earlier than necessary.  It is nonsensical to allow the usual follow-on consequences of death and disability to proceed sooner than actually necessary. 

For example, the preventable loss of a middle aged adult with a young child due to unmanaged chronic disease is not only the loss of a productive worker but the loss of a parent and will have financial costs for decades to come.  Not only is foster care extraordinary expensive, but having your only parent die in childhood is one of the most traumatic events for a child, and setting up the next generation for much increased likelihood of various negative outcomes ranging from drug addiction to imprisonment to simply dropping out of school and becoming dependent on social assistance for life.  

To drive this point home, compare British Columbia which has adopted universal drug coverage for HIV medications versus Ontario which has not (very large drug co-pays are required in Ontario).  Since effective treatment of HIV makes the person non-infectious, universal drug access is a great way to halt the epidemic and many specialists believe it will have to be the primary tool if we actually wanted to do so.  (As a society we clearly do not, as we have had the technologies necessary for about a decade now but choose not to use them.)

Between 1995 with the availability of effective antiviral treatment and 2013, the number of new HIV infections in British Columbia fell by nearly 300% while in Ontario they have increased about 10%.",1

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;A common assumption is that belief in conspiracy theories and supernatural phenomena are grounded in illusory pattern perception. In the present research we systematically tested this assumption. Study 1 revealed that such irrational beliefs are related to perceiving patterns in randomly generated coin toss outcomes. In Study 2, pattern search instructions exerted an indirect effect on irrational beliefs through pattern perception. Study 3 revealed that perceiving patterns in chaotic but not in structured paintings predicted irrational beliefs. In Study 4, we found that agreement with texts supporting paranormal phenomena or conspiracy theories predicted pattern perception. In Study 5, we manipulated belief in a specific conspiracy theory. This manipulation influenced the extent to which people perceive patterns in world events, which in turn predicted unrelated irrational beliefs. We conclude that illusory pattern perception is a central cognitive mechanism accounting for conspiracy theories and supernatural beliefs.",0

It really takes some staggering mental gymnastics to comprehend the duality of this website, which can simultaneously applaud champions of freedom and those who aim to squash any speech which they deem uncouth (or worse yet, call for government interference in otherwise lawful speech).

This article quantifies the extent of the conflicts of interest in the most used medical texts (medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry). It does not (and does not claim to) say if the conflicts of interest had any impact on the texts themselves. The standard practice for journal articles and clinical practice guidelines is for the authors to disclose their (potential) conflicts of interest (pCoI); however, this practice is not standard among medical textbooks. **It should be.** Readers need to know if the authors have a vested interest in the content they are reading.

Replicating viral vector platform exploits alarmin signals for potent CD8 T cell-mediated tumour immunotherapy.

Abstract:

&gt; Viral infections lead to alarmin release and elicit potent cytotoxic effector T lymphocyte (CTLeff) responses. Conversely, the induction of protective tumour-specific CTLeff and their recruitment into the tumour remain challenging tasks. Here we show that lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can be engineered to serve as a replication competent, stably-attenuated immunotherapy vector (artLCMV). artLCMV delivers tumour-associated antigens to dendritic cells for efficient CTL priming. Unlike replication-deficient vectors, artLCMV targets also lymphoid tissue stroma cells expressing the alarmin interleukin-33. By triggering interleukin-33 signals, artLCMV elicits CTLeff responses of higher magnitude and functionality than those induced by replication-deficient vectors. Superior anti-tumour efficacy of artLCMV immunotherapy depends on interleukin-33 signalling, and a massive CTLeff influx triggers an inflammatory conversion of the tumour microenvironment. Our observations suggest that replicating viral delivery systems can release alarmins for improved anti-tumour efficacy. These mechanistic insights may outweigh safety concerns around replicating viral vectors in cancer immunotherapy.

In Study 1, they asked 80+ participants what they had for breakfast before challenging them with a social game. Basically, the game makes one person offer a share of money to another person, and if the receiver rejects it neither person gets the money.  Previous studies have shown that the more unfair the distribution, the higher the rejection rate.  (IE, I'm more likely to get you to accept a 50/50 split or a 40/60 split than I am to get you to accept at 10/90 split).  Both the giver and the receiver are aware of the rules of the game.

What they found is that there was a statistically significant difference in the rejection of unfair offers, whereby those who had consumed high carbohydrate breakfasts were about 15% more **likely** to reject an unfair offer.  Their methods are sound.  This is definitely a statistically different outcome.  Unsurprisingly ""medium unfair"" was not statistically different but trended pretty nicely in the same direction, just not meeting the power bar.

In Study 2, they wanted to see if they could replicate the findings by ADMINISTERING breakfast randomized to both conditions (high carb/protein vs low carb/protein).  They replicated the results and also showed that it's not probably related to tyrosine levels (previously indicated in research).

The numbers for study 1 were 87.  For study 2 it was 24.

Its a sound article.  It's just one result, but it's well done.

"24293",25464,"It always starts in college where you binge drink.  After graduating you're in your 20s with money.  Your friends will constantly want to go out during the week, whether that's happy hours on Tues., for dinner on Thurs. or for a night out on the town on Fri./Sat.  Everything revolves around alcohol.  Then when you get to your late 20s you find yourself polishing off 2-3 beers every single day as soon as you get home from work, you might also even have a glass of wine with dinner everyday.  By the time you're in your 30s and 40s, you're now at a 6 pack or more every single day after work and you're killing a 30 pack all by yourself every single week.  I know tons of my friends who have followed that pattern, although they don't always stick to beer but also include a sifter of brandy, some whiskey neat, or other liquor when they get home from work.  One of them admitted to me that they have to have a pint glass full of vodka w/ some sort of juice or something every single day in order to fall asleep - and that's probably after several beers right after work when they're cooking dinner or watching some type of sporting event (baseball, basketball, hockey, football).  

I almost never, ever keep liquor or beer in the house for this very reason.  I am not prude at all and enjoy my fair share of pints and whiskey, but there's simply too much temptation to start drinking at home every day right after work.  1-2 beers after work eventually turns into 2-4. 10 years later it is a 6 pack everyday and you've got a massive beer gut.

Second, and more of interest to me, is the correlation between the negative impact of obesity on your health, and your success. I used to be healthy and have a normal weight. I was doing quite well. I'm now pretty fat (the fault is solely my own), and that triggered a long list of minor health issues that add up. Acid reflux and sleep apnea making me sleep like crap. Back and knee pain. I don't breath as well in general. I'm tired more easily. When I'm tired, I'm not nearly as productive.

Fortunately, I don't have kids and started off quite privileged, so I have a lot of time and money to help me compensate and cope with it. Otherwise? These health issues (not big enough to claim any kind of medical condition, but enough to trash my productivity) would probably have gotten me fired 10 times over. That would obviously not help my finances very much.",1

This sounds like the opposite of science. If we discover evidence of a multiverse, why is our only option to resign ourselves to never understanding it? How is this any different than saying that it's God's will, and we can't understand God? If we can show that a multiverse exists by measuring interactions with other universes, then why should we automatically assume we can't learn more about said universes?

The article states:

&gt; A new study, spanning 24 years of data, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that states that had enacted stricter gun laws saw domestic violence homicide rates drop - and not just gun-related homicides committed by their intimate partners.

However the study states:

&gt;To check the validity of our findings, we investigated whether laws requiring persons subject to IPV-related restraining orders to surrender their firearms were associated with other crime-related outcomes not expected to be affected by these laws. We found no significant relationship between these laws and stranger homicide rates, violent crime rates, or property crime rates. We also confirmed that the relationship between restraining order relinquishment laws and IPH rates remained significant when we included region-specific time trends and state fixed effects in the model. We also reran the analysis using the traditional proxy for household gun ownership (the percentage of suicides committed with a firearm) used in other studies (41), and the results were unchanged. Finally, the results remained unchanged when we controlled for state laws requiring universal background checks, permits to purchase handguns, or waiting periods for the purchase of handguns.

http://annals.org/aim/article/2654047/state-intimate-partner-violence-related-firearm-laws-intimate-partner-homicide

The study's only conclusion is that laws that restrict individuals with a history or a proven proclivity for intimate partner violence reduce intimate partner homicide and intimate partner violence.  Which makes sense, as most intimate partner violence is the product of inflamed emotions and when immediate access to a deadly weapon is removed the individual has time to cool off and most people are able to regain control of their faculties at that time.

"12032",12206,"I don't think this study makes the point it's trying to make.  In the study people read two stories.

Two guys spend the same amount of money on a car.  The first buys a new, reliable, but not flashy car.

The second buys a used car but tricks it out with new paint, a stereo, and rims.

The results were that people think the first guy is a more suitable long-term mate whereas the second is more interested in sexual relationships.

Honestly, I think there are a lot of things going on here other than ""conspicuous spending.""   

First, these stories have weird underlying connotations other than just conspicuous spending.  Buying a used vs. new car has its own connotations (even budget aside, buying a new car is seen as higher class).  So does paying for things like rims and a stereo (which has juvenile and ghetto connotations).

The second guy has the potential to come off as irresponsible, sleazy, ""faking wealth"" (""I can't afford a new car so I buy a junker and try to make it look good""), and probably in many people's minds, ghetto trash.  Plus, it's clear his motives are just to try to impress others with wealth he doesn't appear to actually have.

That's a completely different scenario from just conspicuous spending.  I'm sure you'd get ***completely*** different results if the stories were about two men who are equally wealthy, and one who conspicuously spends (e.g., buying a mansion, brand new luxury car, flashy clothes) and one who doesn't (e.g., buying a more-than-adequate but not extravagant house, cars, and clothes).  I'd guess people would prefer the guy who conspicuously displays his wealth in this scenario. 

Second, in this study people *knew* the guys had the same amount of money.  That's not something people automatically know about new potential partners.  So, it's possible that even if people could just *see* the cars the guys bought in the current study without knowing that their budgets were the same (or that the second guy's car was bought used), that women would ***guess*** the second guy is wealthier and might be more attracted to him as a longer term partner.",0

Really, all there is is emotional regulation. When you are not being controlled by your emotions, you can either be a good or a bad person for *reasons* and not because you're acting on animal impulse.

Growing up, I remember that a big environmental concern was human activity causing ozone depletion in our atmosphere, leading to the so-called 'ozone hole'. It was quite the concern, if I remember correctly. Luckily, strong environmental policy and research advocacy led to the enactment of legislation restricting the use of the chemicals that were causing ozone depletion. And, recent news studies suggest that this approach worked - the ozone layer appears to be 'healing'.

It's obvious that none of the people working on the article has played video games. The pic they put right under those words? Lara Croft from Tomb Raider, a heroine who kicks ass. The first Tomb Raider came out in 1996. ""Lately"" they focused on that. Right.

&gt; To gauge sexism, students were presented with the statement, ""A woman is made mainly for making and raising children,""

It depends on how the student thinks. Biologically that is a valid statement. Though it's impossible to see how that would be linked with games, where female characters rarely do anything connected with children.

&gt; decades of a sexist status quo in video games

Really, this seems more of bashing on video games and gamers than any real research. Why sexism is considered to be discrimination of women in the first place? Sexism is discrimination based on sex. Any sex. If a woman has a right to be offended at the image of motherhood, I have a right to be offended at the image of buff guys with zero intelligence.

If you actually take a look at how women are portrayed in video games, then yes, you'll find damsels in distress. Same with TV. But you will also find women filling roles that in reality are dominated by men. Mass Effect has a lot of female soldiers and officers, yet in reality that is rare. ",0

They treated him like he didn't exist. Wouldn't let him sign paperwork, didn't really acknowledge he had created this child also and had just as much of a say as I did. They asked ME questions, and on days where he went to the hospital without me (2 trip after hard labor meant I couldn't make the trip) they still pretended like he was nothing more than a boyfriend.

In this article, we focus on relational motivation, describing evidence that conservatives are more likely than liberals to: (1) prioritize values of conformity and tradition; (2) possess a strong desire to share reality with like-minded others; (3) perceive within-group consensus when making political and non-political judgments; (4) be influenced by ""watchful eyes"" and sources who are perceived as similar to them; and (5) maintain homogenous social networks and favor an ""echo chamber"" environment that is conducive to the spread of misinformation.",0

Since high alcohol intake is a causal factor in a multitude of chronic conditions, it's logical they didn't live around to get dementia.

Options are what? Pay better wages? Average wage of a fisherman is 27K a year plus usually bonuses for amount of fish processed or if contracts are finished. You could outlaw the weight/catch incentives, but that would only lead to a shortage of ships and crew which would then drive prices up because very few are going to risk their life for only $27K/year.

Corporations are special groups though. They are not just groups of individuals, really. Publicly traded corporations have a responsibility to their investors to act in their interests.

This means they are a group acting in the interests of another group which has imperfect information about the first group. It practically requires corporations as a whole to act legally but extremely unethically in a way that we would not accept from individuals. It seems to basically require the corporation to act like psychopaths, with the people unwilling to do the individual acts in each of their respective areas of responsibility being replaced if they do not.

But I never saw a dime of the $30k my university charged for tuition even in years when I wasn't taking coursework.

Thankfully my university covered my tuition that semester while I stayed home with the kid. 

If that had not been the case I would have been taxed on $15k that semester while I didn't take a single course, attend a single lecture, use the library, or anything else. And I definitely didn't get any portion of that $15k in my bank account.

Individual differences in the mere willingness to think analytically has been shown to predict religious disbelief. Recently, however, it has been argued that analytic thinkers are not actually less religious; rather, the putative association may be a result of religiosity typically being measured after analytic thinking (an order effect). In light of this possibility, we report four studies in which a negative correlation between religious belief and performance on analytic thinking measures is found when religious belief is measured in a separate session. We also performed a meta-analysis on all previously published studies on the topic along with our four new studies (N = 15,078, k = 31), focusing specifically on the association between performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test (the most widely used individual difference measure of analytic thinking) and religious belief. This meta-analysis revealed an overall negative correlation (r) of -.18, 95% CI [-.21, -.16]. Although this correlation is modest, self-identified atheists (N = 133) scored 18.7% higher than religiously affiliated individuals (N = 597) on a composite measure of analytic thinking administered across our four new studies (d = .72). Our results indicate that the association between analytic thinking and religious disbelief is not caused by a simple order effect. There is good evidence that atheists and agnostics are more reflective than religious believers.",0

Abstract

The rapid growth of genetic ancestry testing has brought concerns that these tests will transform consumers' racial and ethnic identities, producing ""geneticized"" identities determined by genetic knowledge. Drawing on 100 qualitative interviews with white, black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and Native Americans, the authors develop the genetic options theory to account for how genetic ancestry tests influence consumers' ethnic and racial identities. The theory maintains that consumers do not accept the tests' results as given but choose selectively from the estimates according to two mechanisms: their identity aspirations and social appraisals. Yet consumers' prior racialization also influences their identity aspirations; white respondents aspired to new identities more readily and in substantively different ways. The authors' findings suggest that genetic ancestry testing can reinforce race privilege among those who already experience it.

For the most part airlines are already working to choose the most efficient routing on a daily basis - i.e. lowest fuel burn and enroute time (which both result in lower greenhouse gas emissions). But safety and weather/turbulence avoidance take a much higher priority than efficiency any day so it's not always possible to choose the best available routing anyway, particularly in the summer period which is where peak demand for air travel lies. Moreover, our Air Traffic Control system prohibits the use of the most efficient routing in the highest traffic areas of the US and for the vast majority of flights the world over for that matter. There are plans in place to improve that but there are simply no easy solutions especially since by the time an upgrade is implemented it is already virtually obsolete due to the ever growing demand on airspace capacity.

Just reading the abstract and the article, it should be noted that this is measuring overall survival. This should be the most important marker but it's sometimes hard to get that early on for drugs, especially if people live for a long time with cancer. Prostate cancer for example, people routinely live 5-10 years with it. So if you want approval of a new drug and all you look at is overall survival, you're going to have to wait 10 years to finish the study and get approvals before the drug is available, even if in 100% of patients you see 0 sign of cancer anywhere in the body after a month of treatment. 

Now there are many situations where improvements on imaging don't correlate with overall survival, which is why overall survival is still the gold standard, but having a bit of wiggle room in the definition for drugs that show tremendous imaging benefits is fair since you have a pretty high likelihood of having survival benefits in that case (although not 100% of course). 

Having 57% of drugs being in that category does seem a bit high to me but we really have to look at these individually. 

Also the median overall survival benefit does have to be taken with a grain of salt as well. Occasionally you see minimal benefit in the median survival but when you look at like the 5 year survival you see huge benefits. We get those situations when you have a drug that only works in a % of patients. You get like 10% of patients living 5 years longer on the drug but 90% of patients show no benefit at all, so the median (patient who had a response just in the middle) shows basically no benefit since they're part of that 90% that shows no benefit. Drug is still incredibly useful for those 10% so of course it should be approved (with attempted to figure out which 10% respond of course if possible) but when you do studies like this, it makes the numbers look pretty bad.

Abstract

We replicated and extended Shoda, Mischel, and Peake's (1990) famous marshmallow study, which showed strong bivariate correlations between a child's ability to delay gratification just before entering school and both adolescent achievement and socioemotional behaviors. Concentrating on children whose mothers had not completed college, we found that an additional minute waited at age 4 predicted a gain of approximately one tenth of a standard deviation in achievement at age 15. But this bivariate correlation was only half the size of those reported in the original studies and was reduced by two thirds in the presence of controls for family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment. Most of the variation in adolescent achievement came from being able to wait at least 20 s. Associations between delay time and measures of behavioral outcomes at age 15 were much smaller and rarely statistically significant.",0

The MRI is more sensitive but it is not specific. The biopsy is specific. Every test for prostate cancer is a way of determining the risk of prostate cancer. The two most common tools are 1) PSA and 2) the digital rectal exam.

1. A PSA above 4 is a *risk factor* for prostate cancer. A PSA above 4 means you have an elevated risk of prostate cancer. There are cases where the PSA is low and you have prostate cancer. And there are cases where the PSA is markedly elevated and you don't have prostate cancer. Usually urologists will look as PSA *trends* to gauge whether someone needs a biopsy or not. Things like an infection or urinary retention can cause the PSA to skyrocket so urologists will treat the infection and measure the PSA 4 months later to see that it went down. 
2. The DRE looks for the presence of nodules, firmness, or asymmetry to the prostate. Having a nodule again increases the *risk* of having prostate cancer. **edit:** A DRE also checks for anal tumors. A colonoscopy does not look for anal tumors.

Both of these tests help determine when a biopsy is required. Sometimes people do not want a biopsy so there are other options. 

1. Parametric MRI - Its sensitive for *high grade* prostate cancer, especially if there is seminal vesicle involvement or extra capsular extension. However this will not do anything for low grade prostate cancer and it will also not specify the gleason score of the cancer. **edit** of note, many people are now getting these MRIs, before or after a biopsy. This test provides a lot of useful information
2. FISH test - this is a DNA probe that will look for abnormalities. This will tell you if your *risk* is greater or lower. 
3. PCA3 test - another test that will only tell if your *risk* is higher or lower

**However, none of these tests are absolute. They only determine the *risk* of having prostate cancer. Also, these tests are often not covered by insurance**

So what does the prostate biopsy involve. 

1. An ultrasound probe will be placed in your bottom and will initially be used to calculate the size of your prostate. A normal prostate starts around 15 cc and becomes bigger as you age. This is normal and called BPH. 
2. A needle biopsy gun will then be used. The gun is guided by the same ultrasound probe. The gun shoots through your rectal wall and into your prostate, grabbing a core of tissue. This process is repeated 12 times to obtain 12 cores representing your prostate
3.  A DNA swab will be taken from your mouth. If the biopsies are positive for cancer, they will DNA match the cores to your DNA swab to ensure it is indeed your tissue.
4. This procedure can be done in office with local anesthesia or in the OR with general anesthesia. In both cases, the above process is the same. It's a 50:50 split with men who do it in office vs OR. Total biopsy time is 5-10 minutes. 

**Risks of Biopsy**

1. Sepsis - because the rectal wall is being punctured, there is a risk of sepsis. You are put on antibiotics before the procedure and after. Further an IM dose of a potent antibiotic is given 1 hour before the procedure. The risk is about 1 in 200-300. If you become septic, you must go to the ER and get IV antibiotics
2. Bleeding in urine and sperm - this is normal and will only last a few days. Not painful

**Benefits of Biopsy**

1. Number of cores with cancer - The 12 samples that were taken will act as a map to highlight where the cancer is. The number of positive cores helps determine the extent of cancer
2. Gleason score - Ranges from 1-5 however almost all cancers are at least a 3. Each core gets scores. The first number is the grade for the majority of the core and the second core is the remainder of the core. So a low grade cancer is a 3+3=6. A high grade cancer is like a 4+5=9. Note the order of the numbers matters. A 4+3=7 is worse than a 3+4=7.
3. Percent core involvement - This number shows how much of the core has cancer. 10% is low involvement. 100% is very high involvement.

**What happens afterwards**

1. The prostate biopsy allows the urologist to place you in a risk category. This ranges from very low risk to very high risk. This process is called risk stratification.
2. A baseline CT abdomen and pelvis along with a bone scan is obtained to rule out metastatic disease (prostate cancer metastasizes to the bone)
3. He/she discusses treatment options

**Treatment options**

1. Radiation (IMRT) - Usually very effective. You go to the radiation center daily for a few months and have your prostate zapped. Risks include bladder and bowel dysfunction during the treatment which usually resolves after treatment is over **edit:** There is brachytherapy where radioactive pellets are placed in the prostate which deliver a radiation dose over a period of years. This fell out of favor due to a devastating complication of a rectal-anal fistula. Further, all radiation treatments have the side effect of radiation cystitis which can lead to urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia
2. androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) - Uses a drug like Lupron to stop the production of testosterone. Most prostate cancers need testosterone to grow. Usually this is done prior and during IMRT. Side effects include hot flashes, fatigue, and low libido **edit:** The effects wear off when the drug course is over. However some people may have the cancer grow back. These people get placed on intermittent hormone ablation. 
3. (robotic) radical prostatectomy - surgically remove your prostate. This is the gold standard as your are physically taking all the cancer out. Risks include urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. **edit** Risk of positive margins meaning not all of the cancer was removed. 
4. active surveillance - Prostate cancer is a slow growing cancer. If you have &lt;3 positive cores with Gleason score 3+3=6 and a PSA &lt;10, it is perfectly acceptable to do nothing. You will have your PSA drawn every 6 months and a repeat prostate biopsy every 2-3 years. 

There are many other options but these three are the most common. It is up to you to determine the amount of risk you are willing to accept. 

The most important thing in all of this is the yearly PSA and DRE. It is crucial that you have these checked. The PSA is *sensitive* but not *specific*. This does not mean it is not important. An elevated PSA raises your risk of prostate cancer to 20%. A nodule on your prostate increases the risk to 40%. Of that 20-40% risk, there is a 10% risk of having *high grade* prostate cancer. Only the prostate biopsy is absolute. Everything else only changes your *risk*. **Edit:** Typically screening starts at 50 for most men and 40 for men with a family history of prostate cancer

edit2: It seems that there is some controversy with the PSA test. One thing I've tried to be clear in my post is **risk.** We have tools in our arsenal. Not all of them are perfect. There are risks and benefits to every tool. It is your job to make a decision on how much risk you want to undertake. The USPSTF recommendation is a 2012 recommendation. The industry has taken note and made changes. Specifically the cutoff for PSA is now at 4 and not every diagnosed cancer is treated. 

edit3: The point of this post isn't to give medical advice and I apologize if at times it may have seen so. I'm just trying to illustrate the process that is often a black box for many people. It's difficult to explain this process without trying to give medical advice. I understand that recommending the PSA/DRE falls under medical advice so I've tweaked that sentence to be more lawyer friendly.",0

Abstract:

&gt; Effective anti-tumour immunity in humans has been associated with the presence of T cells directed at cancer neoantigens1, a class of HLA-bound peptides that arise from tumour-specific mutations. They are highly immunogenic because they are not present in normal tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although neoantigens were long-envisioned as optimal targets for an anti-tumour immune response2, their systematic discovery and evaluation only became feasible with the recent availability of massively parallel sequencing for detection of all coding mutations within tumours, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict those mutated peptides with high-affinity binding of autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We hypothesized that vaccination with neoantigens can both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T-cell populations and induce a broader repertoire of new T-cell specificities in cancer patients, tipping the intra-tumoural balance in favour of enhanced tumour control. Here we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20 predicted personal tumour neoantigens. Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%) of the 97 unique neoantigens used across patients, respectively. These T cells discriminated mutated from wild-type antigens, and in some cases directly recognized autologous tumour. Of six vaccinated patients, four had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination, while two with recurrent disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed cell death-1) therapy and experienced complete tumour regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells. These data provide a strong rationale for further development of this approach, alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies.",0

"10896",11048,"**Summary:** This study tested whether gender and racial diversity would increase if bias was eliminated. The researchers attempted this by altering the resumes of potential applicants and asking several managers to shortlist the candidates. A good video describing it [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6QAiog1gnw) 

Three groups were used:

* A control group using the original resumes.

* A group with the names gender-flipped.

* A group with the resumes numbered, rather than named.

**Results:** Surprisingly, the researchers found that gender-scrubbed resumes actually *increased* the chances that the candidate would be male, as did giving a male candidate's resume a female name, indicating that hiring managers are more likely to hire a woman when they know the gender, but more likely to hire a man when the gender is not specified. Race-scrubbed resumes found much the same for racial diversity--white candidates were more likely to be selected if they had a non-white name, and non-white candidates were less likely to be selected if their names were scrubbed. ((EDIT: Fixed for clarity. Sorry about that.))

**Discussion:** How does the methodology look to those of you trained in this sort of thing? Are the numbers significant enough and the study broad enough to make this applicable to the entire Western population? Should more studies be done?

**TL;DR**: If this study is applicable to larger populations, then removing gender and racially-identifying information from resumes actually decreases the overall gender diversity of the employees under the hiring manager.",0

&gt;A sweet source to make acrylonitrile

&gt;Much of the attention directed toward displacing petroleum feedstocks with biomass has focused on fuels. However, there are also numerous opportunities in commodity chemical production. One such candidate is acrylonitrile, a precursor to a wide variety of plastics and fibers that is currently derived from propylene. Karp et al. efficiently manufactured this compound from an ester (ethyl 3-hydroxypropanoate) that can be sourced renewably from sugars. The process relies on inexpensive titania as a catalyst and avoids the side production of cyanide that accompanies propylene oxidation.

In particular, they do not claim that this is going to radically decrease cost or that the petroleum feedstock is a significant driver of the cost of carbon fiber.  I think this is motivated more by a general concept that we should get away from relying on petroleum, because we might run out of it.  It seems to me more likely that we'll stop burning (as much) petroleum, and thus we won't run out, and will have it available for stuff like making carbon fiber.  But even though I find the hype in the Popular Fiction article annoying, I like this research, for the fact low-cost catalyst which might be a real way to reduce the cost, and for avoiding the production of cyanide.

# Edit: 

Adding some more details since there's been so much interest:

From the scientific paper, not the popular science summary, some key numbers and statements around these issues are:

&gt;... state-of-the-art materials capable of producing ACN at molar yields of 83% from propylene. However, fluctuations in the price of the propylene feedstock translate directly to ACN price volatility.  

and

&gt;2 lbs of ACN are required to generate 1 lb of fiber  

and

&gt;On the basis of this proposed process, we performed a techno-economic analysis predicting the selling price of ACN at $0.89/lb from lignocellulosic sugars and $0.76/lb from sucrose. These target prices are in the range of fossil fuel-derived ACN prices between $0.40 and $1.00/lb over the past decade. Additionally, the greenhouse gas emissions from this process were estimated to achieve a 14.1% improvement relative to propylene-derived ACN. 

So that translates to a contribution to the cost of carbon fiber from the feedstock of $0.80 to $2/lb from petroleum or $1.52 to $1.78/lb from the new process.  Best case, we are saving $0.48/lb of carbon fiber; worst case more than doubling the cost.  Making carbon fiber requires more than ACN--it also requires a lot of energy and a lot of special equipment.  The cost of the fibers--not the finished composite parts using them--is about $7-8 in large quantities.  So best case we are talking about a 6 or 7% decrease in cost.  That's a fantastic research contribution, and the authors should be proud of it and that attention it's getting. 

Now given those numbers, consider how the Popular Fiction article begins:

&gt; Carbon fiber is made from oil and other costly ingredients, making the end product exceptionally expensive. That's why carbon fiber shows up in race cars but rarely makes it into minivans.

&gt;That could change. Scientists say it may soon be possible to make carbon fiber from plants instead of petroleum, driving down costs, making the material more widely available for use in cars, planes and other vehicles.

There's a ounce of truth in each of those sentences but it deliberately implies a bigger impact than is plausible.  Especially when you consider that not only is ACN just one part of the cost of carbon fiber: in additon, the cost of the carbon fiber is just one part of the cost of making a carbon fiber composite part.  A lot of progress is being made in making the further steps more automated, but that isn't what this piece of work is about.",0

Abstract

&gt; We explored adolescents' (12- to 18-year-olds; n = 51) awareness of their audience and subsequent self-presentation practices on Facebook and Instagram through focus group discussions. Findings suggest that teens, who are developmentally able to perceive a situation from the third-person perspective and who value peer approval, purposefully share content to appear interesting, well liked, and attractive. Some teens invested great effort into posting by these norms, even asking their friends to help; however, this was more common among girls. Older teens especially discussed taking the perspective of their audience when deciding what to post, which is consistent with the finding that perspective taking continues to develop throughout adolescence. These findings suggest that perspective taking skills and need for peer approval influence self-presentation online.

"26091",27495,"But first episode is not about science. 

I watched about 60 percent of the first episode before I had to give it up.  And the main reason I didn't continue was  there was very little ""science"" there was a lot of recitation of facts that have little context and just seemed to beat the viewer into submission rather than have them come to a proper conclusion. 

Everything about the show was cringe worthy or insulting.  A show for ""Adults"" except what adult was hoping to see Desiigner and a reference to pandas (Yeah I know what the reference is, and I hate that I know it)?   What adult needs hot models rather than a solid discussion of scientific understanding.

What adult expects a panel to DISCUSS science, to not include a couple scientists (ok one guy was a civil engineer the other two didn't mention credentials other than ""writer""...)?   And then to dismiss nuclear power in 30 seconds.... and why? Because two places ""claim"" they don't like.  I put claim in quotes because the way it was stated by Nye it was as if he individually asked every person in the city, when in reality we know he talked to a few people willing to bitch. 

The thing is nothing Nye said is completely wrong.  I take issue with his dismissal of nuclear power, but global warming is happening, I don't think he's correct about the expansion of the fluids being the critical cause of flooding  (or if so why do we constantly talk about the polar ice caps and not that?) 

What I take a real exception to, is that Nye has gotten his credentials from making science accessible to the viewer, and focused on fostering a new discussion.  We've already seen a wonderful revitalization of Cosmos that elevated the discussion once again, and while the final episode is really over done about global warming, the show itself was excellent. 

Instead the first episode of Bill Nye's show is a cringe worthy, live studio audience, which skips science to give us modern science, which is just beating the audience into submission and condescending to them. 

I don't mind another ""Bill Nye the science guy"" (I grew up on Mr. Wizard so I wish he was around, he was the man!) but if you're going to try to claim it's a show for adults, make a show for kids, claim it's a show for science, and instead make it ""science"" you're not going to get my support.

The Schrodinger equation is time symmetrical. You can run it in either direction, and it could in theory propagate signals back in time. However, it doesn't do this, unless that is the Bohmian hidden variable in decoherence? But what absolutely doesn't show symmetry is macroscopic behaviour.

Consider a raindrop hitting the surface of a pond. Ripples spread out, decay into heat, vanish.  How could that be time-reversed? Well, some additional force would have to co-ordinate the conversion of random heat into organised, directional waves that converged to a point. Also converging to this point would be the water molecules that need to restore their purity as a raindrop, and these would be cleanly ejected upwards. Air would then need to form a partial vacuum above the drop and a pressure below it so as to propel it up to the cloud. Now, all of that would need to do work, but let's ignore that. Let's focus on the information that would be needed to coordinate this event. There's a lot of it, deriving from no natural source. So to get macroscopic time reversal you need a completely new engine, one that not merely co-ordinates information but does work. If you had one, you could make anything at all with it. 

Additionally, the universe is falling through time. Gravity between two relatively stationary objects is due to the revolving of the time like vector into a space like one by the mass field between them. That implies that the arrow of time is a timelike version of spacial momentum. The magic time reversal engine would need to fight against that.

She believes that the US conducted the chemical attacks as a way to squeeze in an eventual military intervention and dispose of Assad, who is suspected to have launched the attacks. She also doesn't believe that Assad or anyone would launch chemical attacks on his own people.

But when I asked her questions about the war to see what why she believes this, she couldn't give adequate answers. She didn't know enough about the politics of this war, but made her assumptions out of her skepticism of US intervention. It's normal to have that kind of skepticism, but I thought she definitely wasn't informed enough to take it that far and apply it the way she did. (E.g. she thought it was just Assad vs civilians, without the context of rebel/terrorist groups - didn't know who the fighting sides were when I asked her)

So when it comes to even politics majors, I find this post especially pertinent bc they ofc think they know the most, but are actually just overconfident college kids.

&gt;Intestinal health depends on maintaining a balanced microbial community within the highly dynamic environment of the intestine. Every few minutes, this environment is rocked by peristaltic waves of muscular contraction and relaxation through a process regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS). We hypothesized that normal, healthy intestinal microbial communities are adapted to this dynamic environment, and that their composition would become perturbed without a functional ENS. To test this idea, we used a model organism, the zebrafish, with a genetic mutation that prevents formation of the ENS. We found that some mutant individuals without an ENS develop high levels of inflammation, whereas other mutants have normal intestines. We profiled the intestinal bacteria of inflamed and healthy mutants and found that the intestines of inflamed individuals have an overabundance of pro-inflammatory bacterial lineages, lack anti-inflammatory bacterial lineages, and are able to transmit inflammation to individuals with a normally functioning ENS. Conversely, we were able to prevent inflammation in the ENS mutants by either administering a representative anti-inflammatory bacterial strain or restoring ENS function. From these experiments, we conclude that the ENS modulates intestinal microbiota community membership to maintain intestinal health.",0

3) It is probably not due to confounding by the social and lifestyle factors we were able to adjust for.
4) It could be due to some other factor that we couldn't measure (or can't even imagine!) that is associated with both pepper consumption and mortality.
5) Even *if* it is a true causal relationship, the study doesn't say much about the potential mechanisms. Capsaicin is a possibility, but there are many others.
6) Even *if* it is a true causal relationship, that doesn't mean that if you start eating more hot red chili peppers, you will live longer.

"8366",8482,"In his essay, ""Propaganda: American Style,"" Noam Chomsky talks about how the more educated one is, the more susceptible to media propaganda he/she becomes. 

&gt;	During the Vietnam War, the U.S. propaganda system did its job partially but not entirely. Among educated people it worked very well. Studies show that among the more educated parts of the population, the government's propaganda about the war is now accepted unquestioningly. One reason that propaganda often works better on the educated than on the uneducated is that educated people read more, so they receive more propaganda. Another is that they have jobs in management, media, and academia and therefore work in some capacity as agents of the propaganda system--and they believe what the system expects them to believe. By and large, they're part of the privileged elite, and share the interests and perceptions of those in power.

Women with symptoms of a urinary tract infection but a negative urine culture: PCR-based quantification of Escherichia coli suggests infection in most cases. 

Clinical Microbiology and Infection, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.04.004

Link: http://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(17)30209-4/fulltext

Abstract:

&gt; Objectives

&gt; Our objective was to examine whether or not women with symptoms of a urinary tract infection but with a negative culture (20%-30%) do have an infection.

&gt; Methods

&gt; We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, on top of a standard culture, in urine samples from 220 women with dysuria and/or frequency and/or urgency and from 86 women without symptoms. For symptomatic women, qPCR was also carried out for four sexually transmitted agents.

&gt; Results

&gt; In the symptomatic group, 80.9% (178/220) of the urine cultures were positive for any uropathogen and 95.9% (211/220) were E. coli qPCR-positive. For the control group, cultures for E. coli and E. coli qPCR were positive in, respectively, 10.5% (9/86) and 11.6% (10/86). In the symptomatic group, qPCR yielded 19 positive samples for S. saprophyticus qPCR, one positive sample for Mycoplasma genitalium and one for Trichomonas vaginalis.

&gt; Conclusions

&gt; These findings suggest that almost all women with typical urinary complaints and a negative culture still have an infection with E. coli.

"16556",16799,"To clear up what positive and negative behaviors are (in the context of this study), here's how it was measured:

participants were asked to list 9 positive and negative behaviors that had occurred in their relationship over the last month.

They're then prompted to rate how easily they could recall instances of each behavior, on a scale of 1 (this behavior did NOT happen) to 6 (I was able to think of a specific example, and I could have easily thought of several more).

This is actually a fairly clever way to measure the most negatively perceived behaviors in each participant's relationship, because what may be acceptable behavior for one couple could be a dealbreaker for another couple (ex. sleeping with another person is unacceptable for a monogamous relationship, but fine for a poly couple).

To tie this measure to the results: when a person is going through a stressful period of life, their partner's negative behaviors (as measured above, by the CRI) have a stronger impact on relationship satisfaction compared to their partner's positive behaviors.

**However, the difference between the two is relatively small.** Positive behavior definitely does have an impact; just a little bit less than negative behaviors.

"13196",13386,"This is horrifying. It is only *slightly* reassuring that they claim there was ""no evidence the pigs were awake,"" but given how little we know about consciousness in general (or if pigs even *have* it and to what degree), I don't think we should be doing this. Far too many unknowns.

The researchers themselves have called for ethical regulations. They asked for a ""public discussion"" and admitted this was ""deeply worrying."" Well, here's my two cents: I think that we need to stop *right the hell now* when it comes to these kinds of experiments until we have a better understanding of how to measure consciousness-which, again, these researchers acknowledged they needed, but they proceeded with this anyway. Perhaps if this research would be useful for finding a way to measure consciousness it would be excusable, but there is little indication that their research could even be vaguely applied to that separate endeavor.

A brain should be held to a vastly higher standard than a mere kidney or liver. Experimenting on them willy-nilly isn't just inhumane, it's grotesque.

""But the pigs would have died anyway"" is not an excuse. There is a *reason* humane euthanasia is practiced, even on animals. Just because the ethical regulations we currently have in place did not anticipate this does not mean that they should have proceeded anyway, and just because they acknowledged the existence of the moral quandaries involved does not excuse them for going ahead with it.

I'm not anti-science or anti-medicine, far from it. I'm an ecology student. We often have had to conduct experiments on wildlife in a necessarily destructive manner, and we *always* have to jump through review boards and agencies to get approval, *always* have to consider any humane alternative we can possibly think of, and even when we can find no such alternative, we try to limit suffering as much as humanly possible. Sometimes that means killing small animals like chipmunks with your own hands because the ""ethical"" chemicals are too agonizing and slow, even though the alternative is easier to look away from, and therefore less viscerally and emotionally disturbing. 

Speaking for myself, I would *vehemently* refuse to conduct such an experiment on pig brains. Pigs are intelligent, and research on them has suggested they're more intelligent than dogs and possibly as intelligent as small human children, and all available evidence suggests they're just as capable of suffering and emotional distress as we can observe in dogs and toddlers. Even if it was just a 5% probability that pigs were of an equivalent intelligence to a human toddler, their being experimented on like this is *simply not worth the risk* in my estimation.",0

Abstract:

&gt; Importance  Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity.

&gt; Objective  To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.

&gt; Design, Setting, and Participants  Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.

&gt; Exposures  County of residence.

&gt; Main Outcomes and Measures  Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk.

&gt; Results  Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95% UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60%, 74%, and 27% of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74% of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors.

&gt; Conclusions and Relevance  Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.",0

Springmann, M. et al., 2016. **Analysis and valuation of the health and climate change cobenefits of dietary change**. PNAS, 113(15), pp.4146-4151.

&gt;Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6-10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29-70% compared with a reference scenario in 2050. 

&gt;The food system is responsible for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, of which up to 80% are associated with livestock production.


&gt;Reductions in meat consumption and other dietary changes would ease pressure on land use and reduce GHG emissions. Changing diets may be more effective than technological mitigation options for avoiding climate change and may be essential to avoid negative environmental impacts such as major agricultural expansion and global warming of more than 2°C while ensuring access to safe and affordable food for an increasing global population.

&gt;Agriculture is responsible for up to 30% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, about 70% of freshwater use, and occupies more than one-third of all potentially cultivatable land, with animal-based foods being particularly major contributors to these environmental changes

de Vries, M. &amp; de Boer, I.J.M., 2010. **Comparing environmental impacts for livestock products: A review of life cycle assessments**. Livestock Science, 128(1-3), pp.1-11.

&gt;Production of 1 kg of pork required 8.9-12.1m2 and 1 kg of chicken 8.1- 9.9m2 of land, whereas production of 1 kg of beef required 27-49m2 of land. 

&gt;Production of 1 kg of pork resulted in 3.9-10 kg CO2-e and production of 1 kg of chicken in 3.7-6.9 kg CO2-e, whereas production of 1 kg beef resulted in 14 to 32 kg CO2-e. 

&gt;Differences in environmental impact among pork, chicken, and beef can be explained mainly by three factors: utilization of nutrients and energy in feed, differences in enteric CH4 emission between pigs and chicken, and cattle, and differences in reproduction rates.

&gt;Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides. 

&gt;Livestock are an important contributor to global warming through the production of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide). Worldwide, the livestock sector is responsible for approximately 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, approximately equivalent to all the direct emissions from transportation.

&gt;The use of nitrogen fertilizers in feed and manure production contributes 75-80% of annual agricultural emissions of N2O, equivalent to 2,200,000,000 tons of CO2. Some data suggest that N2O is the largest livestock-driven climate change threat, primarily resulting from the production of manure and the intensive over-use of fertilizers for the production of animal feed 

&gt;Land-use change involves not only the release of carbon with the conversion of forests and other habitats into grazing pastures, but also the conversion of natural grasslands into intensive feedcrop agriculture, which is an ongoing trend in developing countries as intensive, industrial livestock production is increasing

I gave birth to my daughter back in 2014. I had very, very, bad postpartum depression, not totally surprising because I had a premature baby and it was a hard time. When my daughter was around 4 months old, she would go to Grandma's for the weekend so I could relax a bit. (I was also working full time). 

One weekend, a friend recommended that I try LSD because ""it would help with my postpartum depression"". And honestly, I was desperate to feel better, so I did. I had my husband to watch me and make sure everything went smooth, and it did! I had a nice trip and felt really relaxed the next day or so.

 However, after the nice feelings went away, I spiraled into the scariest part of my life. I began experiencing postpartum *psychosis*, as well as very severe anxiety, which I had never had before. It lasted about 6 months, the worst of it. I could barely function. I left my husband. My parents raised my daughter for that 6 months because I literally went crazy. I even quit my job. 

Now, 4 years later, I can function, my husband and I are back together, and my daughter is my best friend. But my anxiety is still very severe, and I'm on antipsychotics.

Do I think the LSD caused my anxiety? Well, I don't know. But I think it definitely triggered a massive psychotic episode and some lasting personality changes. As I type this, I'm in bed on a sunny Saturday because I'm having ""an episode"" where I just...can't.

Rat stem cells were then injected into the mouse embryos and implanted into a surrogate. Because the rat cells still contained the genes for organ formation, the resulting chimaeras grew organs largely composed of rat cells ([Rat cells in red](http://i.imgur.com/um3UasC.png)). The resulting hybrid lived the normal lifespan of a mouse.

Separately, scientists also attempted the hybridization of humans and pigs (sorry, no bear). Using the same modifications, pig embryos were injected with various types of human [induced pluripotent stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell). _These chimeric embryos were allowed to develop for three to four weeks before being destroyed_. Integration of human cells into the pig embryos was not very successful, with only about 1 in 100,000 cells in the embryo being human.

&gt; **Summary:** Interspecies blastocyst complementation enables organ-specific enrichment of xenogenic pluripotent stem cell (PSC) derivatives. Here, we establish a versatile blastocyst complementation platform based on CRISPR-Cas9-mediated zygote genome editing and show enrichment of rat PSC-derivatives in several tissues of gene-edited organogenesis-disabled mice. Besides gaining insights into species evolution, embryogenesis, and human disease, interspecies blastocyst complementation might allow human organ generation in animals whose organ size, anatomy, and physiology are closer to humans. To date, however, whether human PSCs (hPSCs) can contribute to chimera formation in non-rodent species remains unknown. We systematically evaluate the chimeric competency of several types of hPSCs using a more diversified clade of mammals, the ungulates. We find that naïve hPSCs robustly engraft in both pig and cattle pre-implantation blastocysts but show limited contribution to post-implantation pig embryos. Instead, an intermediate hPSC type exhibits higher degree of chimerism and is able to generate differentiated progenies in post-implantation pig embryos.",0

Abstract:
&gt; Temperature sounding microwave radiometers flown on polar-orbiting weather satellites provide a long-term, global-scale record of upper-atmosphere temperatures, beginning in late 1978 and continuing to the present. The focus of this paper is a lower-tropospheric temperature product constructed using measurements made by the Microwave Sounding Unit channel 2, and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit channel 5. The temperature weighting functions for these channels peak in the mid to upper troposphere. By using a weighted average of measurements made at different Earth incidence angles, the effective weighting function can be lowered so that it peaks in the lower troposphere. Previous versions of this dataset used general circulation model output to remove the effects of drifting local measurement time on the measured temperatures. In this paper, we present a method to optimize these adjustments using information from the satellite measurements themselves. The new method finds a global-mean land diurnal cycle that peaks later in the afternoon, leading to improved agreement between measurements made by co-orbiting satellites. The changes result in global-scale warming (global trend (70S-80N, 1979-2016) = 0.174 C/decade), ~30% larger than our previous version of the dataset (global trend, (70S-80N, 1979-2016) = 0.134C/decade). This change is primarily due to the changes in the adjustment for drifting local measurement time. The new dataset shows more warming than most similar datasets constructed from satellites or radiosonde data. However, comparisons with total column water vapor over the oceans suggest that the new dataset may not show enough warming in the tropics.",0

Abstract 

Introduction: Antipsychotic treatment can improve the symptoms of schizophrenia; however, residual symptoms after antipsychotic treatment are frequent. The effects of exercise on the symptoms of schizophrenic patients under antipsychotic treatment are inconclusive. The aim of this randomized case-control study was to examine the effects of aerobic exercise (AE) on the symptoms of schizophrenic patients receiving antipsychotic treatment.

Methods: In total, 33 and 29 participants being treated with antipsychotics for schizophrenia were randomly assigned into the aerobic exercise (AE) group and the control group, respectively. The severities of schizophrenic symptoms were measured using the Chinese version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention in both groups.

Results: In total, 24 participants (72.7%) in the AE group and 22 (75.9%) in the control group completed the study. The results indicated that the severities of positive symptoms and general psychopathology in the AE group significantly decreased during the 12 weeks of intervention but did not further significantly change during the 3-month follow-up period. The severities of negative symptoms in the AE group decreased significantly after 12 weeks of intervention and continued decreasing during the 3-month follow-up period. Interaction effects between time and group on the severities of symptoms on the negative and general psychopathology scales were observed.

Conclusion: AE can improve the severities of symptoms on the negative and general psychopathology scales in individuals with schizophrenia being treated with antipsychotics.

But somehow this logic doesn't extend to children, those who are completely at the mercy of their parents and are the most vulnerable to such abuse. Perhaps it ultimately comes down to the fact that it's easy to abuse someone until they start fighting back, and by that time many people have already internalized it and convinced themselves they either deserve the violence or that it was harmless in the end.

So somehow it still remains a controversial thing to say: Don't hit your kids, in any way, shape, or form. Really, if you're gonna hit anyone, you better have no other options to turn to or some other convincing reason cause normalizing violence and making it a part of their day to day is kind of bad for people.

Abstract:

&gt; In this work, a multijunction solar cell is developed on a GaSb substrate that can efficiently convert the long-wavelength photons typically lost in a multijunction solar cell into electricity. A combination of modeling and experimental device development is used to optimize the performance of a dual junction GaSb/InGaAsSb concentrator solar cell. Using transfer printing, a commercially available GaAs-based triple junction cell is stacked mechanically with the GaSb-based materials to create a four-terminal, five junction cell with a spectral response range covering the region containing &gt;99% of the available direct-beam power from the Sun reaching the surface of the Earth. The cell is assembled in a mini-module with a geometric concentration ratio of 744 suns on a two-axis tracking system and demonstrated a combined module efficiency of 41.2%, measured outdoors in Durham, NC. Taking into account the measured transmission of the optics gives an implied cell efficiency of 44.5%.",0

4. Increasing populations of humans and their increasing affluence together both cause increasing heat retention through many processes, including the building of bridges and creating of consumer products with their byproducts.

5. Without offsetting adjustments, either natural or synthetic, AGW will continue to lead to increasing levels of heat retention, which is expected to unbalance the ecosystems we are familiar with.

The 'utility function' measures the risk-return relationship that is perceived by an agent. In bees, for example, erratic nectar pay offs cause them to follow a low risk strategy, whilst consistent nectar availability from different flower shapes makes them more ""experimental"". Risk can be lowered by the environment - for example, a rule that round flowers always have lots of nectar, angular ones don't but are more common - or it can be lowered by insight on the part of the agent: that, for example, the first visitor to a flower gets most of the sugar. Both of those alter a utility function, making insightful agents more inclined to experiment, and more able to see the bigger game. 

When you are insightful about a game you tend to collaborate more if collaboration can be understood to bring greater rewards. If you don't understand the game then risk seems higher and you may not even perceive opportunities to collaborate, let alone exercise them. ",0

**Abstract:**

&gt;Patients lying in a vegetative state present severe impairments of consciousness [1] caused by lesions in the cortex, the brainstem, the thalamus and the white matter [2] . There is agreement that this condition may involve disconnections in long-range cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical pathways [3] . Hence, in the vegetative state cortical activity is 'deafferented' from subcortical modulation and/or principally disrupted between fronto-parietal regions. Some patients in a vegetative state recover while others persistently remain in such a state. The neural signature of spontaneous recovery is linked to increased thalamo-cortical activity and improved fronto-parietal functional connectivity [3] . The likelihood of consciousness recovery depends on the extent of brain damage and patients' etiology, but after one year of unresponsive behavior, chances become low [1] . There is thus a need to explore novel ways of repairing lost consciousness. Here we report beneficial effects of vagus nerve stimulation on consciousness level of a single patient in a vegetative state, including improved behavioral responsiveness and enhanced brain connectivity patterns.",0

Anecdotally, I would attribute this to the manner in which the language was learnt. English being my primary and first language, it was learnt in a home setting without any formal structure - learning by osmosis. Applying the ""monkey see, monkey do"" analogy, it would follow that a child is much more likely to pick up the mannerisms, colloquialisms and yes - superstitious elements - of their parents' speech.

Academic learning of a language with its more rigid formality offers less opportunity for this to happen, in my opinion and experience. Certainly I learnt how to converse in the three languages I learnt at school, however the studies were more inclined towards formal language and communication (i.e. how to speak French at a job, not how to have a chat over a glass of wine in a bistro), of which superstitious language naturally plays a diminished role. Just my two cents, however I would certainly say that due to the foundation of formal linguistic studies in French, Italian and German and greater familiarity in formalised rather than imaginative language due to said studies, I tend to think in a more logical, rigid manner when switching to one of those.

Abstract for convenience:

&gt;Absolutist thinking is considered a cognitive distortion by most cognitive therapies for anxiety and depression. Yet, there is little empirical evidence of its prevalence or specificity. Across three studies, we conducted a text analysis of 63 Internet forums (over 6,400 members) using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software to examine absolutism at the linguistic level. We predicted and found that anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation forums contained more absolutist words than control forums (ds &gt; 3.14). Suicidal ideation forums also contained more absolutist words than anxiety and depression forums (ds &gt; 1.71). We show that these differences are more reflective of absolutist thinking than psychological distress. It is interesting that absolutist words tracked the severity of affective disorder forums more faithfully than negative emotion words. Finally, we found elevated levels of absolutist words in depression recovery forums. This suggests that absolutist thinking may be a vulnerability factor.",0

If you are convinced that you are actually a member of a group that LIKES the outgroup, your bias is reduced.  In the above study, it was a matter of:

&gt; To induce high ingroup identification, individuals may be asked to work together on a task or teambuilding exercise; to form a group, develop a group name, and wear group-labeled nametags or T-shirts; or to feel that they have a shared or common fate regarding their performance or possibility for a cash payment.

This had measurable impact on views of African-Americans for those people who bought into the artificial group identification.  The last item above (""possibility for a cash payment"") strikes me as why approaches like Red Hats work.  It's the same effect, but in reverse.

So we expanded our search first to the larger, nearby cities eventually traveling all the way to NYC with the same result.  Either doctors can't or don't want to investigate a patient's issue to offer a real solution.  We bounced from doctor to doctor for 8 years before getting a diagnosis.

Abstract

&gt; We investigate the effect of female leadership on gender differences in public and private organizations. Female leadership was constructed using a quasi-experiment involving mayoral elections, and our research used a sample of 8.3 million organizations distributed over 5600 Brazilian municipalities. Our main results show that when municipalities in which a woman was elected leader (treatment group) are compared with municipalities in which a male was elected leader (control group) there was an increase in the number of top and middle managers in public organizations. Two aspects contribute to the results: time and command/role model. The time effect is important because our results are obtained with reelected women - in their second term - and the command/role model (the queen bee phenomenon is either small, or non-existent) is important because of the institutional characteristics of public organizations: female leaders (mayor) have much asymmetrical power and decision-making discretion, i.e., she chooses the top managers. These top managers then choose middle managers influenced by female leadership (a role model). We obtained no results for private organizations. Our work contributes to the literature on leadership by addressing some specific issues: an empirical investigation with a causal effect between the variables (regression-discontinuity design - a non-parametric estimation), the importance of role models, and how the observed effects are time-dependent. Insofar as public organizations are concerned, the evidence from our large-scale study suggests that the queen bee phenomenon may be a myth; instead, of keeping subordinate women at bay, our results show that women leaders who are afforded much managerial discretion behave in a benevolent manner toward subordinate women. The term ""Regal Leader"" instead of ""Queen Bee"" is thus a more appropriate characterization of women in top positions of power.

Abstract:

&gt; Electronic cigarettes (""e-cigs"") have recently gained in popularity, but their health risks, including dependence potential are unclear. This study analyzed the adult database from the Wave 1 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a nationally representative survey of tobacco use in the United States, to assess the relative level of dependence among adult, exclusive everyday users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes.

&gt; Of the total 32,320 observations from the Wave 1 PATH adult database, 3586 (5.9%, weighted) were eligible for our analysis population. Among those who met the eligibility criteria, 156 (4.6%) were exclusive e-cig users, and 3430 (95.4%) were exclusive cigarette smokers. Our results show that e-cig users reported a significantly longer time-to-first-use of the day after waking (measured in minutes) compared to cigarette smokers after adjusting for confounders (adjusted geometric mean [95% confidence limits (CL)]: 29.2 [24.4-34.9] vs. 20.0 [18.7, 21.5]). In addition, cigarette smokers were significantly more likely to consider themselves addicted (Adj. Odds Ratio [95% CL]: 6.9 [4.5-10.7]); have strong cravings (2.9 [1.9-4.2]); find it difficult in the past 12 months to refrain from using their product in places where it was prohibited (6.4 [2.9-14.3]); and feel like they really needed to use their product (3.9 [2.4-6.4]).

&gt; These results are consistent with previous studies, in finding that exclusive daily e-cigarette users are less dependent on their respective product than comparable cigarette smokers.",0

I know there have been one or two of us already answering questions in this thread (I'm also a nearly-finished PhD student), but I thought I'd give the perspective of someone not involved directly in this research. I work on much older sites in Africa, although many of the basic ideas are translatable.

The Th/U dating seems reliable, although there'll need to be a more detailed paper published about the stratigraphy of the site. There may be one already, I'm not familiar with this area. That won't be the point of contention. What will cause disagreement here is whether the marks that we see on the bones, and the patterns of breakage on the tools, require hominin action.

I've taken a look at the article and supplementary materials, and I don't think it's enough to base this claim. That's obviously something where it's better to look at the material in person, but what I'm seeing is consistent with a mix of trampling and other natural processes. The authors say that alternate hypotheses ""do not adequately explain the observed evidence"", but then the pictures they show don't seem to support that. The most concrete evidence seems to be a pattern of scratches along the surface of the bone, which *could* be produced by stone tools, but also by lots of other things. Same with the breakage pattern. And same with the broken stone. The stones have one or two features in common with intentional tools, but so do most broken rocks. 

Anyway, I'm not trying to bash this research. It's well done, and it could be the case that a more persuasive argument could be made without the length limits of Nature Letters. This is not my specific subfield, but that being said, I'm quite confident that the mainstream scientific consensus on the peopling of the Americas won't be changed by this research, unless something more compelling is published from this site. It's interesting, but it appears as though the evidence here fits with taphonomic processes just as well as with hominin action.

In Africa, the combined under-5 mortality rate caused by pneumonia and diarrhea alone is 23/1000 live births.  That's about one is 250 children dead of pneumonia/diarrhea, 8 times higher than in Europe, and it doesn't count other kinds of infections (urosepsis, meningitis).  For comparison, the U.S. rate of death from pediatric cancer of any type is a little over 2/100,000: that's 100x lower than the risk of death from pneumonia/diarrhea in countries with poor hygiene.

Abstract

&gt; Majorana zero-modes-a type of localized quasiparticle-hold great promise for topological quantum computing1. Tunnelling spectroscopy in electrical transport is the primary tool for identifying the presence of Majorana zero-modes, for instance as a zero-bias peak in differential conductance2. The height of the Majorana zero-bias peak is predicted to be quantized at the universal conductance value of 2e2/h at zero temperature3 (where e is the charge of an electron and h is the Planck constant), as a direct consequence of the famous Majorana symmetry in which a particle is its own antiparticle. The Majorana symmetry protects the quantization against disorder, interactions and variations in the tunnel coupling3,4,5. Previous experiments6, however, have mostly shown zero-bias peaks much smaller than 2e2/h, with a recent observation7 of a peak height close to 2e2/h. Here we report a quantized conductance plateau at 2e2/h in the zero-bias conductance measured in indium antimonide semiconductor nanowires covered with an aluminium superconducting shell. The height of our zero-bias peak remains constant despite changing parameters such as the magnetic field and tunnel coupling, indicating that it is a quantized conductance plateau. We distinguish this quantized Majorana peak from possible non-Majorana origins by investigating its robustness to electric and magnetic fields as well as its temperature dependence. The observation of a quantized conductance plateau strongly supports the existence of Majorana zero-modes in the system, consequently paving the way for future braiding experiments that could lead to topological quantum computing.",0

Prior to meeting my wife, risk-taking wasn't a part of my being. In fact, the only real risks I took were meeting the women prior to her, and it blew up in my face every time. 

Six years into the relationship with my wife, three years into our marriage, we both lost our (very stable) jobs. We both looked for new work and while I had zero success, she got an offer in her field that she accepted. Two weeks in she simply couldn't handle how customers treated her, and she came home crying. It was at this point that I pushed her _hard_ to follow her dream of opening a bakery. I knew that I would need to be as dedicated to the idea as she was, and accepted the responsibility readily. 

Now, mind you, at this point in time we still had an income. Not a steady one, but it was something that paid the bills through no effort of our own. We had the time, the bills were paid for the time being, so we figured why the hell not?

Fast forward about a year later and it was by far the best decision I could have made. Our 'micro bakery' is paying for itself, though it isn't paying our bills yet. I'm incredibly fortunate to have a father that ran a business for 30 years and understands how tough it is starting out, so now he's paying our way while we get started. It's rough going, we have just enough money to pay the bills and eat. Very little in the way of disposable income, and what little we have we put towards our business. 

Had my wife and I not developed the relationship we have, there's no way I would've suggested such an outlandish idea. Starting a business when you're effectively broke? It could never work! But it is, and we have an incredibly loyal customer base that grows every week. I predict that within two years we'll be profitable (should trends continue) and we're working hard to have our own brick and mortar retail bakery in at least five years. My father has pledged to continue helping us pay our bills until such point as the bakery is profitable. So not only are my wife and I taking a huge risk, my father is taking a huge risk partly due to support from my mother. 

So I don't know if I could put everything into numbers, but my personal experience speaks to the fact that people with support tend to not only take risks, but also succeed in their endeavors. Personally, knowing that I can count on my wife to be there for me is such a huge relief, and she believes the same.

"6897",6991,"The assumption on which all of this is based is that response to public opinion is what generates stability. It may be, but a moment's thought about feedback loops (gain greater or less than unity, positive or negative?) tells you that this is very weak assumption. Further, the assumption that there is a unimodal quality called ""stability"" that is to be maximised is, historically at least, nonsensical. Nationhood was created out of the Thirty Years war and the treaties of Westphalia. A third of European citizens died from violence during the period. Modernity was born in the 1770-1840 period, a period of major turbulence. The formative is not stable. 

Stable government requires a consensus model that is broadly compatible with reality, and authority which is guided in accordance with that model. It is most emphatically not guided by social memes, short-run deal making and a hysterical media with story to create and sell.

"1625",1647,"This is anecdotal, but I grew up in a small town.  My family was below the poverty line in terms of income, though that is obviously deceiving becasue the poverty line is set I think more in terms of city living.  We lived in a run down 1600 sq\-ft house.  Not exactly Haiti.  I had central air.  My parents drove cars.  I didn't even know that we would be considered ""poor"" in some places.  There was always mac n/ cheese or ramen if I got hungry.  

Anyways, people there complain less than the decently well off subhurban people I live around now.  It isn't some huge extraordinary difference.  But honestly in small towns the people who were unhappy were usually struggling with alcohol, drug addiction, or something like depression/anxiety.  

In the big city, I know quite a few people who seem unhappy who do not \(seem\) to struggle with any of these things.  They have everything.  Their bodies work.  Honestly I know people here who seem more upset by who the president is than folks ""back home"" who can't even pay their bills or get a decent job.  

People will point to space.  Rural towns are surrounded by nice quiet space.  Some of it farm fields, some of it more natural.  I don't think it is that though.  

 I think it is community.  I think it is relationships.  The paradox I have encountered in big cities is that despite the fact that there are millions of people, the average person up here has less people that they know well.  That they interact with.  They have more acquainences, but less friends.  Less family.  

I spent the first 19 years in a small town, and the next 15 in a large city and subhurbs.  I STILL know more people in that tiny town well than in this city.  People sometimes say that I'm too open about myself.  That is because I grew up in a place where everyone knew a lot about everyone.  People in major cities are generally more guarded.  More closed off.  They sort of live in bubbles, which is a paradox when you think of it.  

My advice, get to know your neighbors.  Try to invite people to bbq's.  Spend time in your front yard and walking the local areas and stop to talk to people, even if you know it sometimes annoys them.  Break through that stuff.  Do your little part in building community.  Help your neighbors.  I know people who are very upset about underprivilege and people who are struggling, yet when is the last time they helped an elderly person two doors down?  You'll make a bigger positive impact on the world fixing your elderly neighbor's garage chain when it breaks than you will casting some vote or pitching $10 at someone's charity goal.

Tl;dr This is how things progress.  It will be okay.

Edit: A lot of folks are commenting that the engineering vs. doctor analogy is wrong, weak, oversimplified etc.  I get that.  I think my bigger point is that technology has changed a lot of fields and it's turned out fine.

"26492",27955,"As someone that been smoking weed on and off daily for many years, there is any aspect of regular use that no one talks about that I want to bring up. 

Regular use of weed will completely destroy your ability to enjoy regular things. 

Weed magnifies and amplifies sensations and perception, so you get that ""Woaaah"" sensation watching a cool movie or walking through the park. Do it enough times, and now that ""Woaah"" feeling is anchored deeply with weed use. Now regular, sober, life will feel bland. Take that same walk through the park on a nice day sober. Its going to be kind of boring. Watching another cool movie? something is going to feel like its missing. By simple contrast, your brain can no longer get that stimulating sensation from regular life because when you're high, everything gives you that stimulating sensation.

I have never had a problem with abusing weed. I am literally content with taking a hit or two for an evening. It takes me 2-3 months to smoke a quarter ounce of weed. I'm even productive when I smoke, I'll clean my house, pay my bills, run errands. If I have to be mentally sharp for a job interview, I've had no problem stopping for a few days or a week. I've always used this to rationalize to myself, that weed has no negative effects on my life. 

Until recently I've started noticing how hard it is for me to take a few days off from smoking when I have nothing better to do. Come home on a beautiful afternoon with the rest of the day all to myself? I will literally get angry that I told myself I can't smoke for a few days. Everything is stupid or annoying. Watch my favorite TV show? Its boring. Read a book or play videogames? Fuck thats lame, I want to do something else. Those little errands that I had no problem doing after smoking, I can't stand them now. I literally do not want to do anything, and I can't even think of anything I might want to do. The thought process in my head that says, hey you got free time, smoke some weed, there are no downsides, gets incredibly aggressive. 

I think this whole aspect gets overlooked for regular weed users. The effect is very subtle, but it quickly spirals into this regular use pattern, that is hard to break out of, and hard to even every become aware of.",1

Edit:

&gt; Hence, the current rule of thumb that vehicles should become close-packed at stoppages does not appear to be sensible, as safer spacings can be maintained with no reduction in the departure flow rate.

This conclusion seems like quite a leap. There are a few scenarios that come to mind where unsafe conditions could be promoted by increasing the distance between vehicles at rest. Consider the case of a highway offramp that feeds into an intersection. If you were to theoretically decrease the packing distance by, say, a factor of 20 (as tested in the experiment) you increase the likelihood of a high speed rear end collision.

I agree that there are certainly facts in the world, but most of the issues that I have seen in the political arena have little to do with the facts and more to do with framing or interpretation. 

True, sometimes I see flat out false information. A vet was recently labeled a Nazi because of a cross tattoo on his elbow which was really something to do with the symbol of his fighting unit. That was some peoples' paranoia or misinterpretation that went wrong. Dude isn't a Nazi. Fact. Done.

But things get far more complicated. A representative may vote against a bill, for example. The story spreads that he voted against the ""don't kill all the senior citizens bill"". Everyone is enraged that he wants to kill senior citizens, but they don't tell you that the bill just duplicates existing law and there was a rider on it to allow companies to dump toxic sludge in school playgrounds. That's all framing and what you see is a lie by omission of relevant information. 

Or, you hear of some study that says having green eyes means you're paid less. It's all over the news. But 99 percent of the time, none of these people have read the study. Of the ones that did, only half understood it, the rest made up what they wanted it to say. And of the half that understood it, only two or three took the time to analyze it hard enough to understand the flaws in the methods that were used.

And then there's the problem of truth without regard to scale, or correlations that should be expected. For example, when there's a mass shooting and they say they played violent games. I don't know many, or any really, teens who haven't at least played Call of Duty or something similar. How are then going to extrapolate that they cause violence when the majority of kids are being exposed to them?

And, of course there are professional spin jockeys that have agendas to push and will make any story fit their narratives. 

Anyway, I would not be surprised to hear that people have a hard time correcting their misconceptions. Many people are too far indoctrinated and no longer have a grasp on the world around them.

___

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Persistent episodes of extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere summer have been shown to be associated with the presence of high-amplitude quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby waves within a particular wavelength range (zonal wavenumber 6-8). The underlying mechanistic relationship involves the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves with that wavenumber range becoming trapped within an effective mid-latitude atmospheric waveguide. Recent work suggests an increase in recent decades in the occurrence of QRA-favorable conditions and associated extreme weather, possibly linked to amplified Arctic warming and thus a climate change influence. Here, we isolate a specific fingerprint in the zonal mean surface temperature profile that is associated with QRA-favorable conditions. State-of-the-art (""CMIP5"") historical climate model simulations subject to anthropogenic forcing display an increase in the projection of this fingerprint that is mirrored in multiple observational surface temperature datasets. Both the models and observations suggest this signal has only recently emerged from the background noise of natural variability.",0

Abstract

&gt; Despite the wide availability of antibiotics, infectious diseases remain a leading cause of death worldwide1. In the absence of new therapies, mortality rates due to untreatable infections are predicted to rise more than tenfold by 2050. Natural products (NPs) made by cultured bacteria have been a major source of clinically useful antibiotics. In spite of decades of productivity, the use of bacteria in the search for new antibiotics was largely abandoned due to high rediscovery rates2,3. As only a fraction of bacterial diversity is regularly cultivated in the laboratory and just a fraction of the chemistries encoded by cultured bacteria are detected in fermentation experiments, most bacterial NPs remain hidden in the global microbiome. In an effort to access these hidden NPs, we have developed a culture-independent NP discovery platform that involves sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters captured on DNA extracted from environmental samples. Here, we describe the application of this platform to the discovery of the malacidins, a distinctive class of antibiotics that are commonly encoded in soil microbiomes but have never been reported in culture-based NP discovery efforts. The malacidins are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens, sterilize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infections in an animal wound model and did not select for resistance under our laboratory conditions.",0

The doctors have been very impressed with the results. However, they don't have any help to offer. Any time she brings something up to them, they tell her they either haven't heard of it or can't recommend it due to lack of known results. Basically, they will tell her, ""we don't know but what's the harm in trying.""

In other words, if you're doing some form of alternative treatment, you're likely at it on your own. No doctors help, no stacks of research to help, just a little internet voodoo. The fact that survival rates are so high for such unsupported methods by the industry speaks volumes to me.

Cancer is huge business, and there is far too much money in the cut, burn, and poison treatments for alternative treatments to gain a lot of traction.

Abstract

&gt; Background

&gt; In 2014 Health Canada replaced the Marihuana for Medical Access Regulations (MMAR) with the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR). One of the primary changes in the new program has been to move from a single Licensed Producer (LP) of cannabis to multiple Licensed Producers. This is the first comprehensive survey of patients enrolled in the MMPR.

&gt; Methods

&gt; Patients registered to purchase cannabis from Tilray, a federally authorized Licenced Producer (LP) within the MMPR, were invited to complete an online survey consisting of 107 questions on demographics, patterns of use, and cannabis substitution effect. The survey was completed by 271 respondents.

&gt; Results

&gt; Cannabis is perceived to be an effective treatment for diverse conditions, with pain and mental health the most prominent. Findings include high self-reported use of cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs (63%), particularly pharmaceutical opioids (30%), benzodiazepines (16%), and antidepressants (12%). Patients also reported substituting cannabis for alcohol (25%), cigarettes/tobacco (12%), and illicit drugs (3%). A significant percentage of patients (42%) reported accessing cannabis from illegal/unregulated sources in addition to access via LPs, and over half (55%) were charged to receive a medical recommendation to use cannabis, with nearly 25% paying $300 or more.

&gt; Conclusion

&gt; The finding that patients report its use as a substitute for prescription drugs supports prior research on medical cannabis users; however, this study is the first to specify the classes of prescription drugs for which cannabis it is used as a substitute, and to match this substitution to specific diagnostic categories. The findings that some authorized patients purchase cannabis from unregulated sources and that a significant percentage of patients were charged for medical cannabis recommendations highlight ongoing policy challenges for this federal program.",0

Here's another thing: If I have a car that will drive 200 miles per charge, I'm not going to plug it in at work. Daytime is when the grid needs extra power, so how is that going to work?

Abstract: 

Workplace cyberloafing (personal use of the internet during working hours) has been recognized as a form of counterproductive work behavior (CWB) that can harm organizations. In this study, we take an opposing view and argue that cyberloafing can serve a potentially positive function in that it can help employees cope with workplace boredom. We describe a study of the cyberloafing behavior and the experienced underload and boredom of 463 university employees with diverse occupations. Results supported the direct relationships between underload and boredom, and boredom and cyberloafing. The indirect underload-boredom-cyberloafing relationship was also significant. Underload was not correlated with CWB, and the boredom-cyberloafing relationship was significantly stronger than the boredom-CWB relationship. Moreover, comparing competing models supported the suggested direction of the underload-boredom-cyberloafing process, as alternative directions did not fit the data. Together, these findings support the conceptualization of cyberloafing as a boredom coping mechanism rather than a form of CWB and highlight the importance of investigating the impact of underload and boredom on employee behaviors.",0

Alex, it seems as though you didn't comprehend the article very well. The elk that don't favour one hoof over the other are ambidextrous and possess the altered behavioral traits that go with it.
Yes, there's a good chance that this study was funded by the government, as the government issues plenty of (although not enough in reality) funding for fundamental research. This is research that may seem to be, on the surface, pointless, however it serves for greater understanding of the world around us. 
Fundamental research is crucial for the progression of science. It yields surprising insights that quite often lead to new technologies or lucrative applied applications.

"506",509,"I mean, it was already like this.  Any decline in outward displays of platonic affection between men would be due to homosexual behavior first becoming more permissible and open and tolerated, if still not accepted until more recently.

100 years ago, if two men displayed great affection, *obviously* they weren't gay, because if they were gay they would hide it and wouldn't give any hint of it in public.  So they must just be two very good friends with deep history.  And they have no reason to be restrained about that.

Once gay activists started 'coming out' and were public with their sexuality, then public platonic affection could start to be confused for romantic affection, and thus people would be more restrained with it.

You can look to history books, or older works of literature, to see how common it is to portray this.  Going as far back as to Beowolf and Breca or Achilles and Petroclus.  Or as recently as Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee.  

Notice how often you hear someone trying to project gay feelings onto Sam and Frodo.  Their relationship was based off the upper-class British officers, and the lower class batmen that accompanied them and took care of them throughout the war, with a profound degree of loyalty.  Tolkien experienced, and witnessed this first hand and that level of devotion had a profound affect on him.  There's a reason Sam was written as the chief hero of the books.  That's a story written only 60 years ago.

But fast forward several decades, and now everyone wants to project romantic feelings onto any two people of the same sex that show a hint of affection, because they're obsessed with the concept and they can't seem to comprehend a difference between romantic and platonic relationships.

It's no wonder outward affection between men would decline given how easily confused their behavior can be with something sexual.  But it wasn't always like this.

Not to say that homophobia is good or that people shouldn't be comfortable with their partners out in the open.  But this isn't a case where straight men are taking lessons from homosexual men that *""It's okay to display affection.""* and are now 'evolving' new standards of behavior.  Quite the opposite, openly gay men, in some regard, drove the once fairly common affection between straight men into hiding.  And now that effect seems to be lessening.",0

(1) The public doesn't perceive that scientists are not passionate or caring. The public perceives that scientists don't work on issues relevant to everyday concerns and don't come to a single concrete consensus the way other professional classes do. A march isn't going to help explain why, for example, working on the development of a fly eye is relevant to understanding cancer in humans. (It is! Ask a molecular biologist why!) Or why having 98% of scientists agree on man-made climate change IS a consensus. That level of dissent is ridiculously low for matters scientific.

(2) The numbers are going to be poor relative to other marches. The visuals of fewer people than the inaguration or women's march, for example, will not do the scientific community any favors among those who are sore about the perceived ""slight"" by the media about reports of low inaguration numbers.

Abstract

&gt; The goal of this study is to explore a new self-healing concept in which fungi are used as a self-healing agent to promote calcium mineral precipitation to fill the cracks in concrete. An initial screening of different species of fungi has been conducted. Fungal growth medium was overlaid onto cured concrete plate. Mycelial discs were aseptically deposited at the plate center. The results showed that, due to the dissolving of Ca(OH)2 from concrete, the pH of the growth medium increased from its original value of 6.5 to 13.0. Despite the drastic pH increase, Trichoderma reesei (ATCC13631) spores germinated into hyphal mycelium and grew equally well with or without concrete. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed that the crystals precipitated on the fungal hyphae were composed of calcite. These results indicate that T. reesei has great potential to be used in bio-based self-healing concrete for sustainable infrastructure.",0

1: the most deadly cancers (lung, ovarian, pancreatic, GBM) are considered the most deadly because we don't have any good ways to detect them before they metastasize. The vast majority of cancers that can be detected before they metastasize can just be cut out and have extremely good survival rates (Stage 1 breast cancer has 5 year survival of [close to 100%](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/breast-cancer-survival-rates.html)) For some cancers, this could be important, like melanoma or high-grade prostate cancer, but there are already huge advances in melanoma (checkpoint inhibitors and other biological therapies) and high-grade prostate cancer is pretty rare.

More seriously: part of the problem is that your water management is done by administrative regions, we developed separate water boards in the 13th century that ignored political and administrative boundaries and solely focused on water management. If you're going to block water you have to make sure it can get away somewhere safe, either designate places allowed to flood or improve drainage/add pumps. Do note that only improving drainage may lead to lower groundwater levels, which is bad for agriculture/nature. Past few decades we've been restoring floodplains in a controlled manner.

""This new paper describes the analysis of the dissolved oxygen in the global ocean using the most recent version of the World Ocean Database for the period of 1955 to 2015. After careful examination of the data, we found that a statistically significant, widespread O2 decline is emerging beyond the envelope of natural fluctuations. Our study also reveals a tight relationship between O2 inventories and the ocean heat content. The spatial pattern and magnitude of this relationship are consistent with expectations derived from mechanistic ocean climate models forced under climate warming scenarios. Taken together, the trends we document here are suggestive of the effects of the ocean warming beginning to supersede natural variability and emerge as a recognizable signal. This merits additional scrutiny over the coming years.""",0

"3821",3867,"Key takeaway:

&gt; Users online tend to focus on specific narratives and select information adhering to their system of beliefs. Such a polarized environment might foster the proliferation of false claims. Indeed, misinformation is pervasive and really difficult to correct. To smooth the proliferation of unsubstantiated rumors major corporations such as Facebook and Google are studying specific solutions. Indeed, examining the effectiveness of online debunking campaigns is crucial for understanding the processes and mechanisms behind misinformation spreading. In this work we show the existence of social echo chambers around different narratives on Facebook in the US. Two well-formed and highly segregated communities exist around conspiracy and scientific topics-i.e., users are mainly active in only one category. Furthermore, by focusing on users interactions with respect to their preferred content, we find similarities in the way in which both forms of content are consumed.

#


&gt; Our findings show that debunking posts remain mainly confined within the scientific echo chamber and only few users usually exposed to unsubstantiated claims actively interact with the corrections. Dissenting information is mainly ignored and, if we look at the sentiment expressed by users in their comments, we find a rather negative environment. Furthermore we show that the few users from the conspiracy echo chamber who interact with the debunking posts manifest a higher tendency to comment, in general. However, if we look at their commenting and liking rate-i.e., the daily number of comments and likes-we find that their activity in the conspiracy echo chamber increases after the interaction.

A Neurobehavioral Mechanism Linking Behaviorally Inhibited Temperament and Later Adolescent Social Anxiety,

Abstract: 

&gt; Objective

&gt; Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a temperament identified in early childhood that is a risk factor for later social anxiety. However, mechanisms underlying the development of social anxiety remain unclear. To better understand the emergence of social anxiety, longitudinal studies investigating changes at behavioral neural levels are needed.

&gt; Method

&gt; BI was assessed in the laboratory at 2 and 3 years of age (N = 268). Children returned at 12 years, and an electroencephalogram was recorded while children performed a flanker task under 2 conditions: once while believing they were being observed by peers and once while not being observed. This methodology isolated changes in error monitoring (error-related negativity) and behavior (post-error reaction time slowing) as a function of social context. At 12 years, current social anxiety symptoms and lifetime diagnoses of social anxiety were obtained.

&gt; Results

&gt; Childhood BI prospectively predicted social-specific error-related negativity increases and social anxiety symptoms in adolescence; these symptoms directly related to clinical diagnoses. Serial mediation analysis showed that social error-related negativity changes explained relations between BI and social anxiety symptoms (n = 107) and diagnosis (n = 92), but only insofar as social context also led to increased post-error reaction time slowing (a measure of error preoccupation); this model was not significantly related to generalized anxiety.

&gt; Conclusion

&gt; Results extend prior work on socially induced changes in error monitoring and error preoccupation. These measures could index a neurobehavioral mechanism linking BI to adolescent social anxiety symptoms and diagnosis. This mechanism could relate more strongly to social than to generalized anxiety in the peri-adolescent period.",0

**Edit**: While we're on the topic of bias, I'd also like to bring up that the title of this post may be misleading. The study only found that pornography use was  ""negatively related to husbands' [and wives] *unique* sexual satisfaction [emphasis mine] ... but wives' pornography use is positively related to the couple's shared level of sexual satisfaction"" and husbands' pornography use did not affect shared satisfaction levels. The way I read it, that means pornography actually has a *positive* impact on wives' shared sexual experience, and no negative impact on males' shared experience. The negative impact is solely to their *unique* sexual experience, which might not be obvious from the title of this post, especially when the findings of the study suggest both positive and negative impacts of pornographic use.

The way our society is organized, Walmart is supposed to be taking care of those people, providing enough resources for their basic needs to be met, in exchange for them providing the resource of their labor to the business in order to facilitate its existence. But Walmart (and all of them its just an example) has realized that they can pay all of those people waaaaay less than they actually need to survive, because the state will step in with food stamps, welfare, and medicaid to fill in the gaps. And basically every business of a certain scale utilizes these practices. For another example, Facebook lists that their median salary in 2017 was $240,430.

"5678",5749,"I've been reading lately about parasites who manipulate their host's behavior in extraordinary ways in order to for the parasite to move up the food chain or reproduce in mediums that would kill the host. For example, there's a parasitic worm that lays its eggs in the water but lives inside of crickets. It actually interferes with the way that the cricket sees water in order to entice it to jump in and die. This is just one of many. There's another that manipulates pillbugs to stay out in the open where they won't blend in, or one that causes ants to dangle off of leaves (but only in the nighttime, because it would fry in the daytime), in both cases to be more attractive to birds, where both parasites continue their lifecycles.   

I'm a firm believer in evolution, but how would this have really worked? Were their earliest ancestors worms that didn't need hosts to survive - ie did they evolve into being parasites? Is it possible that entire lines of parasites would have just gone extinct if they didn't get one detail correct, ie the worm made ants stay out in the sun and they roasted along with them? I don't believe it points to intelligent design, however these really are incredible adaptations that mimic high-level manipulation which you'd think only we'd be capable of dreaming up. ",0

&gt;We found a consistent positive relationship between profanity and honesty; profanity was associated with less lying and deception at the individual level and with higher integrity at the society level.

**And an explanation as to why profanity may make us more honest:**
&gt;The spontaneous use of profanity is usually the unfiltered genuine expression of emotions...

**And**

&gt;The more controllable use of profanity often helps to convey world views or internal states or is used to insult an object, a view, or a person (Jay, 2009). Speech involving profane words has a stronger impact on people than regular speech and has been shown to be processed on a deeper level in people's minds (Jay, Caldwell-Harris, &amp; King, 2008).

**Finally, my favorite part of the article:**

&gt;Profanity has even been used by presidential candidates in American elections (Slatcher, Chung, Pennebaker, &amp; Stone, 2007) as recently illustrated by Donald Trump, who has been both hailed for authenticity and criticized for moral bankruptcy (Sopan, 2015).

Apparently, there is a sharp divide amongst the population in how they believe truthfulness and cursing are related. It's about a fifty-fifty split between people thinking they are positively or negatively correlated. 

**Those that believe swearing is indicative of deceit cite the following:**

&gt;As dishonesty and profanity are both considered deviant (Bennett &amp; Robinson, 2000) and immoral (Buchtel et al., 2015), they are generally perceived as a reflection of a disregard for societal normative expectations (Kaplan, 1975), low moral standards, lack of self-control, or negative emotions (Jay, 1992, 2000). In this regard, profanity appears to be positively related to dishonesty, explaining why people who swear are perceived as untrustworthy (Jay, 1992) and why swear words are often associated with deceit.

**On the other hand:**

&gt;Profanity can be positively associated with honesty. It is often used to express one's unfiltered feelings (e.g., anger, frustration) and sincerity. Innocent suspects, for example, are more likely to use swear words than guilty suspects when denying accusations (Inbau, Reid, Buckley, &amp; Jayne, 2011). Accordingly, people perceive testimonies containing swear words as more credible. 

Really interesting read for anyone interested. The most interesting method they used was by analyzing Facebook posts for swearing and honesty by using an algorithm that has a 67 percent accuracy for correctly evaluating something as honest or dishonest. 

As an aside, the amount of data Facebook has for these sort of studies is really going to have some interesting results with future studies... Especially as these algorithms continue to become better and better with their accuracy and analyzing the increasing depth of data.

**Edit 1:** Added the study results and edited formatting (as if I know what I'm doing). 

**Edit 2:** This is my first one of these studies to break down like this. Hope I did an okay job, but I'd recommend reading through the whole thing. There were a ton of other interesting things mentioned in the article that I didn't include in this because of space requirements, but I would've included the whole thing if I could have. ",0

Naked mole-rat mortality rates defy Gompertzian laws by not increasing with age

Abstract

&gt; The longest-lived rodent, the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), has a reported maximum lifespan of &gt;30 years and exhibits delayed and/or attenuated age-associated physiological declines. We questioned whether these mouse-sized, eusocial rodents conform to Gompertzian mortality laws by experiencing an exponentially increasing risk of death as they get older. We compiled and analyzed a large compendium of historical naked mole-rat lifespan data with &gt;3000 data points. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed a substantial portion of the population to have survived at 30 years of age. Moreover, unlike all other mammals studied to date, and regardless of sex or breeding-status, the age-specific hazard of mortality did not increase with age, even at ages 25-fold past their time to reproductive maturity. This absence of hazard increase with age, in defiance of Gompertz's law, uniquely identifies the naked mole-rat as a non-aging mammal, confirming its status as an exceptional model for biogerontology.

&gt;The detection of faked identities is a major problem in security. Current memory-detection techniques cannot be used as they require prior knowledge of the respondent's true identity. Here, we report a novel technique for detecting faked identities based on the use of unexpected questions that may be used to check the respondent identity without any prior autobiographical information. While truth-tellers respond automatically to unexpected questions, liars have to ""build"" and verify their responses. This lack of automaticity is reflected in the mouse movements used to record the responses as well as in the number of errors. Responses to unexpected questions are compared to responses to expected and control questions (i.e., questions to which a liar also must respond truthfully). Parameters that encode mouse movement were analyzed using machine learning classifiers and the results indicate that the mouse trajectories and errors on unexpected questions efficiently distinguish liars from truth-tellers. Furthermore, we showed that liars may be identified also when they are responding truthfully. Unexpected questions combined with the analysis of mouse movement may efficiently spot participants with faked identities without the need for any prior information on the examinee.

You've been doing this for *thirty years*. You did it before there was major medical organization support from groups like the AMA, you did it before there were visible trans people as functioning members of society, you did it when someone like me wouldn't have even considered transition because the social and professional cost was so high. But after only five years, I'm really tired. For every thorough debunk, for every point-by-point rebuttal, for every summary of the science in favor, there are a hundred articles with titles like ""Scientists PROVE that TRANS IS A MENTAL ILLNESS"" or (actually from just this past week) [""I'm a Pediatrician. How Transgender Ideology Has Infiltrated My Field and Produced Large-Scale Child Abuse.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/GenderCriticalism/comments/6l2705/im_a_pediatrician_how_transgender_ideology_has/djql0d5/) (of course, they don't hold up under scrutiny, but that's not the point). Every one of those articles is shared a hundred times within a few hours, and there are limits to my time and energy to deal with the same handful of talking points literally thousands of times over.

So my biggest question to you is this: how do you keep it up in the face of such proudly-blind, happily-hostile opposition, when every well-written and thoroughly-researched response is just raking leaves in a windy day?

----------------

I do have a few other questions on a more practical level. You've done clinical practice treating trans people directly, yes? I imagine you see a lot of concerned and uncertain family members. 

What have you found to be the most effective methods for reassuring people about the effectiveness of transition, especially if they're skeptical or dismissive of published studies? 

For those who have had trouble grasping *how* or *why* someone is trans, have you found any useful analogies that get the idea across? I usually [try](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6myabn/transgender_redditers_how_did_you_know_you_were/dk5eye0/) to turn it around and ask how someone would feel if their body suddenly swapped sexes, but I've only found that to work around half the time.

I've gotten substantially different recommendations from different doctors - one wanted to ramp up estrogen and then add progesterone, one wanted high estrogen and discouraged progesterone, and so on. To my knowledge there's not much research to back these up (anecdotally, I found a high-estrogen + progesterone regimen very helpful to my own development).

"15371",15596,"Alright, as the resident antibiotic resistance PhD here, I should chime in.

Since we've known about antibiotic resistance caused by enzymes, the goal has been to find chemicals that could act as enzyme inhibitors, which you could then administer alongside the antibiotic as an [antibiotic adjuvant](http://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/fulltext/S0966-842X\(16\)30072-5) to restore its activity. This has been successful for some combinations of penicillins with [inhibitors of the penicillin-degrading enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Lactamase_inhibitor), but unfortunately not much else. My own PhD project, an [enzyme](http://www.cell.com/structure/abstract/S0969-2126\(16\)30038-7) that acts on  aminoglycoside antibiotics, is another such target that we haven't yet identified good inhibitors for yet. 

This looks like another step foward for antibiotic adjuvants that can reverse resistance, but I'm always very cautious in my optimism, because the bacteria [always find a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMjQ3hA9mEA) around what we might want to throw at them. Nothing is a silver bullet, but I'll make do with some copper ones for now. 

The NDM-1 enzyme made a splash when it was [discovered back in 2009](http://aac.asm.org/content/53/12/5046.full?view=long&amp;pmid=19770275), because it gives resistance to important last-resort antibiotics. Since then it's become a model system for antibiotic resistance as the high profile of the enzyme has made it a target for labs around the world. It's good to see another promising case of new counter-resistance strategies directed toward this enzyme, and I'll be interested in seeing how these inhibitors move forward. It's always a jump to move from mouse models to human trials, but hopefully its successful! We desperately need new clinical options and a high profile new proof of concept for these compounds will be a new breath of fresh air. ",0

Biodegradation of polyester polyurethane by Aspergillus tubingensis,

Highlights

. Aspergillus tubingensis was isolated, identified, and found to degrade polyurethane (PU).

. The SEM and ATR-FTIR results clearly showed the degradation on the surface of PU.

. Esterase and lipase activities were determined in the presence of different supplements to medium.

. This is the first report showing A. tubingensis capable of degrading PU.

Abstract

&gt; The xenobiotic nature and lack of degradability of polymeric materials has resulted in vast levels of environmental pollution and numerous health hazards. Different strategies have been developed and still more research is being in progress to reduce the impact of these polymeric materials. This work aimed to isolate and characterize polyester polyurethane (PU) degrading fungi from the soil of a general city waste disposal site in Islamabad, Pakistan. A novel PU degrading fungus was isolated from soil and identified as Aspergillus tubingensis on the basis of colony morphology, macro- and micro-morphology, molecular and phylogenetic analyses. The PU degrading ability of the fungus was tested in three different ways in the presence of 2% glucose: (a) on SDA agar plate, (b) in liquid MSM, and (c) after burial in soil. Our results indicated that this strain of A. tubingensis was capable of degrading PU. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we were able to visually confirm that the mycelium of A. tubingensis colonized the PU material, causing surface degradation and scarring. The formation or breakage of chemical bonds during the biodegradation process of PU was confirmed using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The biodegradation of PU was higher when plate culture method was employed, followed by the liquid culture method and soil burial technique. Notably, after two months in liquid medium, the PU film was totally degraded into smaller pieces. Based on a comprehensive literature search, it can be stated that this is the first report showing A. tubingensis capable of degrading PU. This work provides insight into the role of A. tubingensis towards solving the dilemma of PU wastes through biodegradation.",0

"5674",5745,"A simple explanation of how the prevention of mother to child transmission works (not necessarily specific to the Thai paper):

HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids and when an HIV+ mom gives birth there is a very high risk of transmitting HIV. The more HIV in your body the higher the chance of transmitting it to the baby (and to partners during sex). ARV drugs stop HIV from replicating thereby reducing the HIV load, reducing the chances of transmitting HIV.

HIV treatment is always improving, whereas in the past, antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs were only prescribed when HIV had ravaged the immune system, today ARVs are administered soon after diagnosis (the sooner you receives treatment, especially before getting sick, the healthier you will be).

In the past, HIV+ usually mothers did not receive ARVs, so babies would be infected in utero, during birth or through breast feeding. But doctors found that giving the mothers single-dose ARV during birth and the babies single-dose ARV after birth, dropped transmission rates drastically. I.e. HIV+ mothers could give birth and raise an HIV- child.

Today HIV+ mothers should be taking 3 ARVs daily, negating the need for single-dose ARV at birth. So in Thailand and other countries where moms (initially received single-dose ARV) and now receive full ARV treatment there is basically zero chance of transmitting HIV during birth, breastfeeding and unprotected sex (yes if you have unprotected sex with an HIV+ person who *TAKES* ARVs and their HIV load is *UNDETECTABLE* you are (almost certainly) not in danger of infection).

Some extra info:
HIV infects and destroys immune cells and so infections that the immune system normally controls (cold/flu) become life threatening. When HIV has destroyed the immune system and the patient is mortally ill this is called acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Some more extra info:
In the past HIV was a death sentence but today people can live healthily into old age but only if they take their ARVs (or they risk deteriorating to AIDS). HIV is never cleared from a person, it inserts itself into your DNA, so when the cells divides, it copies the HIV. So even when the ARVs kills all the circulating HIV, the integrated HIV remains, and can be activated.

Last bit of info:
Where did HIV come from and when? Testing preserved tissues shows that the earliest human infections occurred in the 20th century. HIV is related to a virus found in primates (SIV- simian immunodeficiency virus). In fact SIV is ancient and has been infecting primates for such a long time that most apes do not get sick when infected by SIV. Analysing the sequences of HIV and SIV we see that SIV passed into humans at least 3 times (probably from hunting and eating the apes): chimp, gorilla and sooty mangaby.",0

Abstract

High-quality relationships have been shown to be beneficial for physical and mental health. This study examined overall relationship satisfaction and perceived stress as well as daily reports of partner support, partner conflict, and physical intimacy obtained over the course of one week in a sample of 129 high and low stress mothers. Telomere length was examined in whole blood, as well as the two cell subpopulations: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and granulocytes. Telomerase activity was measured in PBMCs. Analyses revealed no statistically significant associations of telomere length with current relationship satisfaction, daily support or conflict, or perceived stress. In contrast, women who reported any sexual intimacy during the course of the week had significantly longer telomeres measured in whole blood and PBMCs, but not in granulocytes. These relationships held covarying for age, body mass index, perceived stress, the relationship indices, and caregiver status. Sexual intimacy was not significantly related to PBMC telomerase activity. These data provide preliminary data that sexual intimacy is associated with longer telomere length. Future studies investigating these associations are warranted.",0

Abstract:

&gt; Skin scarring after deep dermal injuries is a major clinical problem due to the current therapies limited to established scars with poor understanding of healing mechanisms. From investigation of aberrations within the extracellular matrix involved in pathophysiologic scarring, it was revealed that one of the main factors responsible for impaired healing is abnormal collagen reorganization. Here, inspired by the fundamental roles of decorin, a collagen-targeting proteoglycan, in collagen remodeling, we created a scar-preventive collagen-targeting glue consisting of a newly designed collagen-binding mussel adhesive protein and a specific glycosaminoglycan. The collagen-targeting glue specifically bound to type I collagen in a dose-dependent manner and regulated the rate and the degree of fibrillogenesis. In a rat skin excisional model, the collagen-targeting glue successfully accelerated initial wound regeneration as defined by effective reepithelialization, neovascularization, and rapid collagen synthesis. Moreover, the improved dermal collagen architecture was demonstrated by uniform size of collagen fibrils, their regular packing, and a restoration of healthy tissue component. Collectively, our natural healing-inspired collagen-targeting glue may be a promising therapeutic option for improving the healing rate with high-quality and effective scar inhibition.",0

Abstract

&gt; To its proponents, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin offers the potential to disrupt payment systems and traditional currencies. It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.",0

We weren't born into money but my mother worked her ass off with 4 kids to get her Masters in medicine to become a nurse practitioner, but that didn't happen until I was about 14 so she taught us good money habits from a super young age. BUT, even she didn't understand this college loan shit. Not until she started paying for some of it to help us out did she really understand what was happening. So, I think parents with kids that are 13-17 at the moment should be talking to their kids about student loans **right the fuck now**. Not about what they wanna be when they grow up. Not about what school they want to go to. But about how much money this entire system drains you of.

Abstract:

&gt; Designing technologies that mitigate the low-dose adverse effects of exposures to large-volume everyday-everywhere chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA, 1a) requires an understanding of the scope of the exposures and the nature of the adverse effects. Therefore, we review the literature of, (i) the occurrences of 1a in humans, waters and products and the effectiveness of widely deployed mitigation methods in 1a stewardship and, (ii) the adverse effects of 1a exposures on human cells and fish. Within this broad context, we present and evaluate experimental results on TAML/H2O2 purification of 1a contaminated waters. TAML/H2O2 catalysis readily oxidizes BPA (1a) and the ring-tetramethyl (1b), tetrachloro (1c), and tetrabromo (1d)-substituted derivatives. At pH 8.5, TAML/H2O2 induces controllable, oxidative oligomerisation of 1a (2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-unit species were identified) with precipitation, establishing a green synthetic pathway to these substances for biological safety characterisation and an easy method for near quantitative removal of 1a from water. TAML/H2O2 (24 nM/4 mM) treatment of 1a (10,000 µg L-1) in pH 8.5 (0.01 M, carbonate) lab water effects a &gt;99% reduction (to &lt;100 µg L-11a) within 30 min. Yeast oestrogen screens (YES) of the pH 8.5, TAML/H2O2 treated, catalase quenched, and filtered oxidation solutions show elimination of 1a oestrogenicity. Zebrafish developmental assays of TAML/H2O2 treated, unfiltered, agitated pH 7 1a solutions showed no significant incidences of abnormality among any of 22 endpoints-treated samples showed an insignificant increase in mortality. At pH 11, the TAML/H2O2 oxidations of 1a-d are fast with second order rate constants for the substrate oxidation process (kII) values of (0.57-8) × 104 M-1s-1. The 1a oxidation gives CO and CO2 (~78%), acetone (~25%) and formate (~1%). In striking contrast with pH 8.5 treatment, no oligomers were detected. TAML/H2O2 (150 nM/7.5 mM) treatment of 1a (34,244 µg L-1) in pH 11 (0.01 M, phosphate) lab water effected a &gt;99.9% reduction (to &lt;23 µg L-11a) within 15 min. The pH dependent behaviour of 1a was examined as a possible origin of the differing outcomes.",0

I am assuming that when these kinds of studies are published in reputable journals, they are controlling for those kinds of factors. 

What we are looking at when we study and discover these kinds of phenomena is Epigenetics, which is a very *real,* but incredibly mysterious physiological effect that throws out our standard views of biology. 

Generally we agree that evolution is a process that takes millenia and that major changes occur slowly, stacking up over time, from mutation and selection events. But it also appears that our bodies (and the bodies of all other organisms) can enact rapid changes that happen within generations via Epigenetics, where certain genes are targeted due to stimuli experienced by the organism. These changes, packing and unpackaging of DNA or the promotion or silencing of genes can actually persist and be transferred to the offspring of an organism -- Even if those offspring never experienced the event. It is as if our DNA has a 'memory' that can, in some cases, be passed on. 

Bottom line -- Take these studies with a grain of salt, Epigenetics is super weird and not well understood, but we do have compelling evidence that it *does* happen; Even if we don't necessarily understand the underlying mechanisms yet. It is, honestly, one of the most exciting areas of current biological research, because it just so clearly subverts many decades of foundational understanding. ",0

Highlights

. Psilocybin with psychological support was used successfully to treat depression.
. Amygdala responses to fearful faces were increased one day after psilocybin session.
. Increased amygdala responses predicted positive clinical outcomes.
. Psilocybin assisted therapy treats depression by reviving emotional responsiveness.

Abstract

&gt; Recent evidence indicates that psilocybin with psychological support may be effective for treating depression. Some studies have found that patients with depression show heightened amygdala responses to fearful faces and there is reliable evidence that treatment with SSRIs attenuates amygdala responses (Ma, 2015). We hypothesised that amygdala responses to emotional faces would be altered post-treatment with psilocybin. In this open-label study, 20 individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe, treatment-resistant depression, underwent two separate dosing sessions with psilocybin. Psychological support was provided before, during and after these sessions and 19 completed fMRI scans one week prior to the first session and one day after the second and last. Neutral, fearful and happy faces were presented in the scanner and analyses focused on the amygdala. Group results revealed rapid and enduring improvements in depressive symptoms post psilocybin. Increased responses to fearful and happy faces were observed in the right amygdala post-treatment, and right amygdala increases to fearful versus neutral faces were predictive of clinical improvements at 1-week. Psilocybin with psychological support was associated with increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli, an opposite effect to previous findings with SSRIs. This suggests fundamental differences in these treatments' therapeutic actions, with SSRIs mitigating negative emotions and psilocybin allowing patients to confront and work through them. Based on the present results, we propose that psilocybin with psychological support is a treatment approach that potentially revives emotional responsiveness in depression, enabling patients to reconnect with their emotions.",0

It is reasonable to interpret ""want"" in this context as signifying consent. That is probably how I would read it if participating in this study. That is, I think most people would read ""Does she want to continue?"" and ""Is she willing to continue?"" as asking the same question with respect to whether she is consenting to continue, and not distinguishing ""want"" as meaning ""does she want to continue, whether or not she is willing?"". Those are different questions, and from what I can tell the authors were not careful to disambiguate between the two.

Once a Cheater, Always a Cheater? Serial Infidelity Across Subsequent Relationships

Abstract

&gt; Although there is a large body of research addressing predictors of relationship infidelity, no study to our knowledge has specifically addressed infidelity in a previous relationship as a risk factor for infidelity in a subsequent relationship. The current study addressed risk for serial infidelity by following adult participants (N = 484) longitudinally through two mixed-gender romantic relationships. Participants reported their own extra-dyadic sexual involvement (ESI) (i.e., having sexual relations with someone other than their partner) as well as both known and suspected ESI on the part of their partners in each romantic relationship. Findings from logistic regressions showed that those who reported engaging in ESI in the first relationship were three times more likely to report engaging in ESI in their next relationship compared to those who did not report engaging in ESI in the first relationship. Similarly, compared to those who reported that their first-relationship partners did not engage in ESI, those who knew that their partners in the first relationships had engaged in ESI were twice as likely to report the same behavior from their next relationship partners. Those who suspected their first-relationship partners of ESI were four times more likely to report suspicion of partner ESI again in their next relationships. These findings controlled for demographic risk factors for infidelity and held regardless of respondent gender or marital status. Thus, prior infidelity emerged as an important risk factor for infidelity in next relationships. Implications for novel intervention targets for prevention of serial relationship infidelity are discussed.",0

The one thing that I do that I think helps at least a little, and doesn't require anyone else to contribute, is leaving at least a car length in front of me while I'm in the exit lane and there's a huge line backed up. The reason is, whoever gets in front of you has already made the choice to cut the line (sure, they might not have realized it was their exit until they were passed the back of the line). But whether they cut right in front of you, or all the way up at the front of the line at the last second, they're going to be in front of you regardless. If you leave enough room though, you won't have to slow down. If you don't leave room, or if they skip your space and go ahead anyways, and jump in last minute, the person they cut off will brake, and the people behind them will all brake harder, adding to the chaos. So leave the space, let them in so that others ahead won't have to brake, and the whole line will move a bit more smoothly.",1

Thanks for your important work in this area. I donated to your efforts. I have a question on the natural/holistic approaches to SIBO and dysbiosis that are everywhere online. There are a lot of anecdotal reports that 'natural' antimicrobials like certain essential oils, antimicrobial foods and teas, and supplements like allicin from garlic are more effective and less dangerous than antibiotics in culling bad bacteria. But it seems like we'll never know because expensive clinical trials are not investigating things that can't be patented and then sold for maximum profit. Also, there seems to be no incentive to actually cure, just treat symptoms, since cured people are not good future customers.What do you think of this common criticism of the modern medical system, where the profit-motive and the public good seem so often misaligned? The logic makes sense to me, but I'm open to being proved wrong. As someone coming from this establishment system, how will any solution you developed be different?",0

This is because when you inhale an unfiltered cigarette, you don't inhale as deeply, so there's less of your lung exposed to the smoke. Also you don't hold the smoke in as long.

Conversely, he said the most dangerous cigarette would be an ultra-light menthol. The menthol numbs your lungs, so you can hold the smoke longer, and the ultra-lightness of the cigarette causes you to draw it deeper into your lungs.

That made sense to me. I kept smoking for a while after the lecture, but I switched to unfiltered Camels. I found it was a great way to cut down on my smoking and eventually quit. I had the urge to smoke less often, which disrupted my habit, and I tended to smoke less of each cigarette, being more aware of the smoke going into my lungs with each puff.

A simple lack of insight and perspective results in copious amounts of misdirected judgement and assumptions in the area, particularly towards SSRIs.

SSRIs **are not magic pills that will eliminate your anxiety/depression**. SSRIs do just what **their name suggests,** they increase the basal levels of serotonin, which has concretely been shown to have a negative correlation with anxiety, depression, etc. This doesnt solve the problem, it makes the overall context somewhat milder, it gives space. And what then goes in to that space is the psychology and psychotherapy. Because the source of anxiety and depression is abstract (human, societal concepts) and hence no, SSRIs arent a magic solution but by god they are absolutely a part of one. Both SSRIs and psychotherapy can be a very effective combination, just because one is less effective without the other does not mean it isnt effective in general.

Copious amounts of people individually discredit SSRIs; ""they make my anxiety worse, I feel on edge, side effects etc."" But SSRIs do that. Their very function relies on changing the equilibrium of serotonin. **Of course this is going to unsettle things in the short run**. But these people a) do not give SSRIs enough time or b) are prescribed them without a complement of psychotherapy (which is crucial) and hence dont really utilize the *potential* benefits in the context that they create.

SSRIs address the general tone of mind in a subtle, but effective manner, to reduce the overall ""roughness"" of the experience, making the state of mind more neurologically prone to change, and psychotherapy addresses the abstract and fundamental patterns of thinking that result in mental illness, measuring one without the other is equivalent to misrepresenting the optimal context of

All-in-all the biggest issues you face in Immuno-Oncology aren't that your molecule ""doesn't work"", the issue is typically balancing efficacy with toxicity because the antigens you're targeting aren't limited to just your tumor cell. Ideally your tumor over-expresses the antigen of interest relative to other cell types so that you can minimize collateral damage. But that's the inherent flaw with a 'runaway' viral vector, and there are also going to be complications there with a replication competent virus in an immunocompromised patient who's already undergone multiple lines of existing chemotherapies before heading to the Clinical Trials.

&gt;**Abstract** 

&gt;Monsoon systems around the world are governed by the so-called moisture-advection feedback. Here we show that, in a minimal conceptual model, this feedback implies a critical threshold with respect to the atmospheric specific humidity qo over the ocean adjacent to the monsoon region. If qo falls short of this critical value qoc, monsoon rainfall over land cannot be sustained. Such a case could occur if evaporation from the ocean was reduced, e.g. due to low sea surface temperatures. Within the restrictions of the conceptual model, we estimate qoc from present-day reanalysis data for four major monsoon systems, and demonstrate how this concept can help understand abrupt variations in monsoon strength on orbital timescales as found in proxy records.",0

1: Cesium based perovskites are much more stable than the organic hybrid perovskites that are typically used in solar settings and encapsulation doesn't get much better than sandwiched between two thick pieces of glass in a window, so a lot of the stability concerns mentioned or concerns that it will never work because it's a perovskite system isn't really the case.

2: Cesium isn't the material you should be concerned about in terms of toxicity, lead is.  It's the second component in the perovskite and we all already know how bad lead can be for humans.

3: Heat from the sun concerns! So in the paper itself it's very vague as to what temperature they constitute as low temp and high temp as well as the rates of conversion; however looking at the supplemental as well as just knowing about cesium lead halide perovskite conversion temps it looks like the change happens around 150C.  So the sun won't be causing the switch on by itself, I'm assuming a small local heating system would be implemented as a turn on switch to allow for the perovskite to convert and start absorbing sun.  There isn't much info in the paper as to how the perovskite converts back to transparent... I'm not so sure they have that figured out yet.

4: Cost! These perovskites are still made from very inexpensive metal salts and are processed at low temperature from solutions so cost is still much lower than traditional solar cells as well as any other new generation solar tech that is being worked on. 

But all in all, the paper was to show the concept of a solar cell that can be switched on, which is a cool and exciting prospect so you can't expect everything to be fully worked out, especially because the field moves so fast it's kinda like a race to show new innovations.

I think the value of money works like this.

* If you are poor, money doesn't buy happiness, but it does by food.  It buys security, comfort, healthcare, stability, and a host of very important things.  it doesn't buy happiness but it gets rid of a lot of problems.  It gets rid of a lot of misery.

* If you have enough money to buy most of the things you want, then a bit more money doesn't mean very much to you.  A couple extra shirts, a nicer car, an expensive dinner out, these things are fleeting.  They do not buy happiness.  Advertising tells us we should want them.  They might be fun for a few minutes, but they don't buy lasting happiness.  The difference between making 100k and year and 110k a year is pretty trivial.  The difference between 30k and 33k is much more significant.  Certainly 10k means more to a person making 30k then it does to a person making 100k.

* Then there is another level of wealth.  If you have around 3 to 5 million dollars invested properly you can live quite well and never have to to work.  At this level money is freedom.  You no longer need to sell your time.  Even someone making 100k a year is bound to his job.  His time is not his own.  He must work to maintain his lifestyle.  But the multi-millionaire is free.  he can take 3 months hike the Appalachian trail.  He can sail around the world.  He can learn to paint.  He can spend 30 hours a week working for habitat for humanity.

Basically

* poor people - Money buys security and stability.  
* For middle class - Money doesn't buy happiness. 
* For upper class - Money buys freedom.

The trick for middle class is to diligently save and invest.  Its not ~~terribly hard~~ complicated to achieve financial independence.  It just take 30+ years.  (/r/financialindependence/)

I have until the end of May to finish up my thesis re-submission and I'm probably going to end up throwing away 4 years of work due to depression an anxiety surrounding my PhD.

I started in 2010 and by 2013 I'd become so anxious and emotional due to fear of failure and perceived lack of interest in my work from my supervisors, I was recommended anti-depressants and a some time away by my doctor.  Since then I've had several extensions, submitted my thesis to a less-than-flattering viva and have been told to resubmit after major changes.

In that time I became increasingly self-destructive towards my relationships with my wife, friends and family, and with my work. I also have become reclusive due to embarrassment, as the majority of my friends are PhD graduates that seemed to have a relatively easy time of it.

In late 2014, I took a graduate position at a software company and my day-to-day mental state has improved dramatically. I still get the occasional day or week of feeling anxious, helpless or generally upset, but avoiding thinking about my thesis and how I've wasted so many years tends to keep that at bay. I work with people a good 4-5 years younger than me and I am a similar number years behind where someone of my age _should_ be in my career. But I'm happier.

Basically, my PhD broke me and has had a significant negative impact my ability to feel comfortable and enjoy life. I have a lot of support from my wife and family and I do feel like I can get better if I can just put it all behind me. The worry of explaining a 4 year gap in my CV to a potential new employer is scary but I'll cross that bridge when I come it it.

Sorry for the long, rambling post but it feels good to get this off my chest. Reading that my problems aren't uncommon makes me feel vindicated in some respects.

My advice to any aspiring PhD students would be to not be embarrassed to ask for help and if you feel you need it, ask for it early. Don't let it spiral out of control and cause significant damage to your health and well-being. I feel like I'd be in a dramatically different place right now if I followed my own advice.

Article Text:

MARCH 2, 2018 For the past 40 years, the total number of Adélie Penguins, one of the most common on the Antarctic Peninsula, has been steadily declining-or so biologists have thought. A new study led by researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), however, is providing new insights on this species of penguin.

In a paper released on March 2nd in the journal Scientific Reports, the scientists announced the discovery of a previously unknown ""supercolony"" of more than 1,500,000 Adélie Penguins in the Danger Islands, a chain of remote, rocky islands off of the Antarctic Peninsula's northern tip.

""Until recently, the Danger Islands weren't known to be an important penguin habitat,"" says co-PI Heather Lynch, Associate Professor of Ecology &amp; Evolution at Stony Brook University.  These supercolonies have gone undetected for decades, she notes, partly because of the remoteness of the islands themselves, and partly the treacherous waters that surround them. Even in the austral summer, the nearby ocean is filled with thick sea ice, making it extremely difficult to access.

Yet in 2014, Lynch and colleague Mathew Schwaller from NASA discovered telltale guano stains in existing NASA satellite imagery of the islands, hinting at a mysteriously large number of penguins. To find out for sure, Lynch teamed with Stephanie Jenouvrier, a seabird ecologist at WHOI, Mike Polito at LSU and Tom Hart at Oxford University to arrange an expedition to the islands with the goal of counting the birds firsthand.

When the group arrived in December 2015, they found hundreds of thousands of birds nesting in the rocky soil, and immediately started to tally up their numbers by hand. The team also used a modified commercial quadcopter drone to take images of the entire island from above.

""The drone lets you fly in a grid over the island, taking pictures once per second. You can then stitch them together into a huge collage that shows the entire landmass in 2D and 3D,"" says co-PI Hanumant Singh, Professor of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University, who developed the drone's imaging and navigation system. Once those massive images are available, he says, his team can use neural network software to analyze them, pixel by pixel, searching for penguin nests autonomously.

The accuracy that the drone enabled was key, says Michael Polito, coauthor from Louisiana State University and a guest investigator at WHOI. The number of penguins in the Danger Islands could provide insight not just on penguin population dynamics, but also on the effects of changing temperature and sea ice on the region's ecology.

""Not only do the Danger Islands hold the largest population of Adélie penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula, they also appear to have not suffered the population declines found along the western side of Antarctic Peninsula that are associated with recent climate change,"" says Polito.

Being able to get an accurate count of the birds in this supercolony offers a valuable benchmark for future change, as well, notes Jenouvrier. ""The population of Adélies on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula is different from what we see on the west side, for example. We want to understand why. Is it linked to the extended sea ice condition over there? Food availability? That's something we don't know,"" she says.

It will also lend valuable evidence for supporting proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) near the Antarctic Peninsula, adds Mercedes Santos, from the Instituto Antártico Argentino (who is not affiliated with this study but is one of the authors of the MPA proposal) with the Commission for the Conservation of the Antarctic Marine Living Resources, an international panel that decides on the placement of MPAs. ""Given that MPA proposals are based in the best available science, this publication helps to highlight the importance of this area for protection,"" she says.",0

Abstract

Objectives University academic achievement may be inversely related to the performance of the secondary (high) school an entrant attended. Indeed, some medical schools already offer 'grade discounts' to applicants from less well-performing schools. However, evidence to guide such policies is lacking. In this study, we analyse a national dataset in order to understand the relationship between the two main predictors of medical school admission in the UK (prior educational attainment (PEA) and performance on the United Kingdom Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT)) and subsequent undergraduate knowledge and skills-related outcomes analysed separately.

Methods The study was based on national selection data and linked medical school outcomes for knowledge and skills-based tests during the first five years of medical school. UKCAT scores and PEA grades were available for 2107 students enrolled at 18 medical schools. Models were developed to investigate the potential mediating role played by a student's previous secondary school's performance. Multilevel models were created to explore the influence of students' secondary schools on undergraduate achievement in medical school.

Results The ability of the UKCAT scores to predict undergraduate academic performance was significantly mediated by PEA in all five years of medical school. Undergraduate achievement was inversely related to secondary school-level performance. This effect waned over time and was less marked for skills, compared with undergraduate knowledge-based outcomes. Thus, the predictive value of secondary school grades was generally dependent on the secondary school in which they were obtained.

Conclusions The UKCAT scores added some value, above and beyond secondary school achievement, in predicting undergraduate performance, especially in the later years of study. Importantly, the findings suggest that the academic entry criteria should be relaxed for candidates applying from the least well performing secondary schools. In the UK, this would translate into a decrease of approximately one to two A-level grades.

"15197",15418,"In reality, women who wish to have an abortion will have an abortion. The ""unsafe"" part comes into play when safe abortion in a medical facility performed by an experienced doctor is unavailable(there are many different reasons this happens). The procedure itself is incredibly safe. Having wisdom teeth removed is exponentially more risky in terms of possible complications and the procedure itself. 

Women who cannot access abortion in a legitimate medical setting end up turning to other options. Some of these include taking untested combinations of herbal supplements and vitamins that can end up damaging your liver/interacting with other medications. Some women order mifepristone over the internet and have no instructions on how to take it and what to look out for, which can result in some very nasty and harmful effects. Some women resort to physically harming themselves in a desperate attempt to induce a miscarriage. Some women seek out unlicensed persons who say they'll perform the procedure and end up with infections, uterine/vaginal trauma, even sexual assault. 

The bottom line is that there is more harm done when women are denied access to safe abortion. Your religious and moral beliefs are your own and have no business putting a woman in danger. Women deserve and should be entitled to both safe, legitimate medical care and effective, affordable contraception.

This article examines the notion that personal values played an important role in support for Trump. Using data from the Trump Similarity Values Test (N = 1825), a web based personality test that provides users with feedback on their similarity to Donald Trump, this article shows that personal values played a role in support for Donald Trump. First, people who supported Trump were more likely have a value profile characterized by low Altruism and high Power, Commerce, and Tradition. Second, people with a values profile similar to Trump's (presumed) values profile were more likely to support Trump. These results held even after controlling for party affiliation and political ideology, indicating that personal values were an even stronger predictor of support for Trump than traditional political attitudes.",0

Abstract

&gt; The question of this investigation is, how many hours does it take to make a new friend? Drawing from Dunbar's social brain hypothesis and Communicate Bond Belong theory, friendship status was examined as a function of hours together, shared activities, and everyday talk. In Study 1, MTurk participants (N = 355) who had recently relocated estimated time spent with a new acquaintance. Hours together was associated with closer friendships. Time spent engaging in leisure activities also predicted closeness. In Study 2, first-year students (N = 112) reported the number of hours spent with two new acquaintances three times over 9 weeks. Hours together was associated changes in closeness between waves. Two types of everyday talk predicted changes in closeness.",0

Abstract

&gt; Sequential evaluation is the hallmark of fair review: The same raters assess the merits of applicants, athletes, art, and more using standard criteria. We investigated one important potential contaminant in such ubiquitous decisions: Evaluations become more positive when conducted later in a sequence. In four studies, (a) judges' ratings of professional dance competitors rose across 20 seasons of a popular television series, (b) university professors gave higher grades when the same course was offered multiple times, and (c) in an experimental test of our hypotheses, evaluations of randomly ordered short stories became more positive over a 2-week sequence. As judges completed repeated evaluations, they experienced more fluent decision making, producing more positive judgments (Study 4 mediation). This seemingly simple bias has widespread and impactful consequences for evaluations of all kinds. We also report four supplementary studies to bolster our findings and address alternative explanations.

Because of the treatment types Medicare is set up to cover, seniors are incentivised to wait until absolutely necessary to seek care. By this time we are dealing with an acute care situation, possibly treated in the ER.

Edit: for people interested in this stuff some extra information: 

A crucial thing often going wrong in adolescent/youth interrogation is that the most widely used interrogation technique, called the 'Reid technique', is known to extract false confessions from even adults ('confession finding' instead of 'truth finding'), but is often used on adolescents/youths due to the lack of an alternative/lack of interrogation training/lack of knowledge of findings like these mentioned in the article

At the same time there are questionnaires that indicate that in terms of percentage there is a surprisingly large amount (I can't recall the exact number but a rough estimate would be &gt;40%) of officers that believe that adolescents *do not* require a special interrogation technique, justified by arguments such as 'if they're old enough to be suspect of a crime, then they're old enough to be interrogated', although the Reid technique with standard phrases like 'we know what you've done, you're not going to get away with it' and 'we have witnesses, there is no other option, you'd better confess or you're going to be put away for a much longer time' frequently makes an adolescent/youth suspect under a tremendous amount of stress go from: 'I don't know anything' to 'I'm not sure', to 'maybe I was there?'

""Participants were 487 newly enrolled students at a Danish university in September 2016. The age of the students ranged from 17 to 45 years (mean age = 21.12, SD = 2.39), and the students fell into one of four academic fields: psychology (n = 103; 87% female), economics/business (n = 158; 43% female), law (n = 93; 80% female), and political science (n = 133; 59% female).""

""The Big Five personality traits were measured with the Danish adaptation of the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992; Danish version: Hansen, Mortensen, &amp; Schiøtz, 2004). This 60-item questionnaire measures the Big Five personality traits and their respective six facets with 12 items per factor and two items per facet . . . The Dark Triad personality traits were measured with the Short Dark Triad (SD3; Jones &amp; Paulhus, 2014). The SD3 is a 27-item questionnaire measuring Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy with 9 items per trait.""

""Male students scored significantly higher on all Dark Triad traits than female students, female students scored significantly higher on neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness than male students, and non-significant results were found for extraversion and openness. There was a significant effect of academic major for all personality traits except from extraversion and psychopathy. No significant interactions between gender and academic major were present.""

""Economics/business students scored significantly higher on Machiavellianism than all others and significantly higher on narcissism than both psychology and political science students, supporting H1. Law students scored significantly higher on Machiavellianism than psychology students, also consistent with H1. They did not score higher than political science students on Machiavellianism, though, or significantly higher than any other groups on narcissism. Psychology students scored significantly higher on neuroticism than economics/business and political science students, supporting H2, but not significantly higher than law students. They also scored higher than economics/business and law students on both agreeableness and openness, supporting H2, but not significantly higher on agreeableness than political science students. Political science students scored significantly higher on openness and agreeableness than economics/business and law students, supporting H3. Since no main effect of academic major was found for extraversion, H4 was not supported. Findings not hypothesized were that political science students scored significantly lower on conscientiousness than all other students and that both political science and law students scored significantly higher on neuroticism than economics/business students.""

The authors suggest that because the students they studied are newly enrolled, the differences they detected in this study are more likely to come from self-selection of individuals with different traits for different areas of study than socialization that encourages traits within certain areas of study.

Alzheimers cant be transmitable right?! That's the assumption we come to. Well if we look at what this study shows and the intra-cellular mechanics of alzheimers we see a strong analogy (if not a close to identical symmetry) to prionic diseases. If it's transmissable, acts as a prion protein (ie: like CJD) in its mechanism then **as the study denotes** this means we should simplify the front-line research into alzheimers. Treat it as aforementioned, focusing on the amyloid and tau proteins instead of investing too much resource into the genetics, preventative (ie: more abstract) causes. If we can impede the metabolism of these proteins safely (their transmission and ensuing neuro-degeneration reflect their guilt) then we could stop alzheimers in its tracks by halting its fundamental mechanism when it arises!

"4275",4326,"A couple of issues with definitions and methodology:

**Authors' Definition of Terrorism:**
&gt;the understanding of terrorism as ""the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation"" (Global Terrorism Database, 2016)

**From the [GTD FAQ page](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/faq/):**
&gt;Why doesn't GTD have a single definition of terrorism?
In the absence of a universally accepted definition of terrorism, GTD uses several coded criteria to cover a broad range of definitions of terrorism through a combination of inclusiveness and filtering. The goal is to have a data set that is useful to as many interested users as possible.

**From the [GTD Methodology page](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/using-gtd/):**
&gt;Data for GTD1 (1970-1997) were collected by PGIS. The collectors of the PGIS database aimed to record every known terrorist event within and across countries and over time, as identified in multi-lingual news sources, for the purpose of performing risk analysis for U.S. businesses. Incidents were collected according to the following definition of terrorism: ""the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;It is well-recognized that divergent definitions of terrorism abound and that the nature and causes of terrorism are hotly contested by both governments and scholars.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;While the original GTD1 employed the definition of terrorism utilized by PGIS, the second phase of data collection for the GTD (GTD2: 1998-2007) parsed the PGIS definition into parts and coded each incident so as to allow users to identify only those cases that meet their own definition of terrorism. Based on the original GTD1 definition, each incident included in the GTD2 had to be an intentional act of violence or threat of violence by a non-state actor. In addition, two of the following three criteria also had to be met for inclusion in GTD2: The violent act was aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal;The violent act included evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) other than the immediate victims; and The violent act was outside the precepts of International Humanitarian Law.

So now that we've seen the authors' decided to only include one of the definitions that GTD uses when categorizing incidents and asserted it as **THE** definition, let's take a look at methodology.

**Methodology:**
&gt;We looked at media coverage for terrorist attacks in the United States between 2011 and 2015, as listed in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). While the GTD lists 110 terrorist attacks during this five-year span

This number of incidents is accurate **IF** you do not require that Criterion 1 be met when using the [GTD search](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/). What is Criterion 1 you ask:

&gt;Criterion I: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal.

Seems like a pretty important part of any definition of terrorism. While this only brings the number of incidents down to 96, the larger issue is that not only have the author's excluded an important Criterion for the definition of terrorism, but they have also neglected to state such in their paper. This raises questions about whether the rest of their methodology is similarly lacking in transparency.

* If you were made commissioner of the FDA, what sorts of changes and policies would you pursue?

* The FDA has policies to incentivize drug companies to develop therapies for diseases that affect small populations (orphan drugs).  While this is important to allow drug companies to recoup R&amp;D costs for treating patient populations that would otherwise be unprofitable to serve, many have charged various drug companies with abusing orphan drug rules to extend the lifetimes of many of their patents without creating much value added.  Do you think current orphan drug policies are working well and if not, are there any changes to these policies that could solve some of the abuses?

"10060",10202,"It seems like a lot of people are misinterpreting the results. The 16:8 group was compared to a control group that was told to maintain their weight. Therefore, the study doesn't necessarily show that fasting is inherently beneficial outside of a behavioral context (IE the restricted time produces a net reduction in calorie intake), or beneficial compared to a traditional diet with equated calorie intake. 

The fact that there were no differences in fat mass, visceral fat mass, or lean body mass, despite subsequent weight-loss suggests that what is actually changing is simply the last component of body composition, water. They don't list the actual weigh in times, but if it occurred before the fasting group ate, this isn't surprising. It would be like comparing your weight when you wake up before breakfast vs after. It's also not surprising that someones blood pressure would be lower after an extended period of just drinking water vs someone else who has been consuming food with sodium (probably high in an obese person). 

Lastly, it's also important to keep in mind that calorie intake reporting among obese individuals is notoriously unreliable. The fact that seemingly obese individuals reported somehow  only eating ~1600 calories a day while still maintaining their weight in the control group is very likely grossly inaccurate.

This is the single most irresponsible piece of refereed journal climate science press coverage I have seen in my career. 

Before down voting/crucifying, please see flair. This is what I do. I am a stable isotope geochemist. This is LITERALLY my life. [I am VPN'ed into one of our stable isotope ratio mass spectrometers as I type this.](https://i.imgur.com/Lm8T6PM.png) 

No, this one paper does not make anything worse than we thought. No it does not undo or call into question decades of paleoceanography and paleoclimatology work and knowledge, acquired through herculean efforts across multiple disciplines, using a variety of proxy tools conceived by brilliant minds.

The researchers investigated how the temperature signal recorded in oxygen isotope ratio of fossil organisms, set when they formed their calcium carbonate tests in seawater, might be ""reset"", or changed by diffusion of these oxygen isotopes through the solid calcium carbonate crystal, and towards a new equilibrium ratio, controlled by both the warmer temperatures they experience buried in sediment, and the oxygen isotope ratio of sediment porewater bathing them.

This diffusion to a new equilibrium isotope value would manifest as some magnitude and rate of ratio change until fossil recovery millions of years later. This recovery is from within long sediment cores we carefully select. Such low temperature, low pressure oxygen diffusion can be thought of as incomprehensibly slow. Think tens of millions of years. The authors claim this slow change in the fossil isotope ratio is what actually shapes the gradual but large cooling through the Cenozoic we observe through measuring the isotope ratios of these fossil tests in the first place. The problem is... that's not our only line of evidence for the cooling, AND we have real-world data from isochronological fossil tests at vastly different burial depths showing that this diffusion makes no measurable difference whatsoever. This is the shallow drive-by of a group led by personalities who want to be famous/controversial. 

While this headline has begun to go viral, I have read the original paper several times. And my head is still spinning. Such ABSURDLY grandiose interpretations completely ignore all corroborating paleoclimatic data. This is one of those extraordinary claims that require extraordinary evidence. There is just some run-of-the-mill P-chem and a neat isotope labeling experiment with very incomplete ""differential diagnoses"". The claims here are so EASILY falsifiable that I saw a handful of extremely bright scientists do it over a matter of mere hours, on TWITTER of all places. I'm talking to you, Nature, for chrissakes. Not one physical chemist as a reviewer? Not one old school paleoceanographer or paleoclimatologist? Not even one google-capable referee? Since it's Nature Communications, the reviews are all available.

&gt; People occasionally choose to cut themselves off from their online social network by taking extended breaks from Facebook. This study investigated whether abstaining from Facebook reduces stress but also reduces subjective well-being because of the resulting social disconnection. Participants (138 active Facebook users) were assigned to either a condition in which they were instructed to give up Facebook for five days or continue to use Facebook as normal. Perceived stress and well-being, as well as salivary cortisol, were measured before and after the test period. Relative to those in the Facebook Normal condition, those in the No Facebook condition experienced lower levels of cortisol and life satisfaction. Our results suggest that the typical Facebook user may occasionally find the large amount of social information available taxing, and Facebook vacations could ameliorate this stress-at least in the short-term.

A couple of questions that spring to mind:

- They write that ""those in the No Facebook condition experienced lower levels of cortisol and life satisfaction"" So, I assume they mean higher life satisfaction.

Beyond that:

- How many people assigned to the No Facebook group complied throughout the study? (do we have cortisol/satisfaction for dropouts?)

- What was baseline FB activity like? How many hours per day?

- What was the magnitude of change in cortisol/life satisfaction levels?

"9395",9525,"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and it has continued to be something I've dealt with into my early 20s. Although undiagnosed, my father, uncle and grandfather also had similar signs during their childhoods. My mother was not overweight when she got pregnant with me, and so I believe there may have been a strong genetic component involved.

One of the problems I've faced often with my condition is poor impulse control, especially in regards to over eating. I find myself always ""hungry"", although I think often I'm just looking for something to occupy myself, some sort of stimulation and I use eating or tasting to satisfy that. It means that I often eat much more than I should. I regularly take medication [concerta] to help control my attention problems and a side effect of that is that it reduces my appetite to the point that it counters my tendency to overeat and I'm able to maintain a healthy weight. A day when I don't take my medication results in constant eating or snacking as well as general agitation and restlessness.

My point is that I wonder if there could be a relationship between undiagnosed impulse control problems in women and ADHD. Perhaps a percentage of obese or overweight women have an undiagnosed attention problem that they self-medicate with eating the way I find myself doing involuntarily. It's possible that ADHD in children could be a result of it being passed genetically rather than epigentically.

I believe ADHD is diagnosed in young boys (like I was) much more often than in young girls, so it's possible that an attention disorder could go undiagnosed in these women.",0

It's a ""gradient cell"", basically it generates power from the concentration difference between two reservoirs. A loose analogy is the pressure in a tank of air, there is energy in that pressure and if you release that pressure through a small generator you can generate power from it. Gradient cells instead draw power from having a high concentration on one side, and releasing that ""pressure"" by mixing it with the low concentration side to produce power. 

It doesn't actually destroy or remove carbon dioxide. We're taking the high concentration of carbon dioxide from the exhaust of a furnace and still ejecting it into the air, we're just pushing it through this battery first.

What's the point? We can use it to squeeze out a few more percent efficiency from our power plants. Manufacturing plants may use it to squeeze out a tiny amount of power from their emissions to offset their regular power needs a bit.

But the carbon dioxide still ends up in the air. It does NOT reduce or solve it. (except maybe making our systems a tiny bit more efficient)

It's like saying we have a wind-turbine that runs on carbon dioxide... because we put it directly in the way of an exhaust stream containing carbon dioxide. Yes... technically that description is true. But the carbon dioxide is still a problem. And it's more or less running on the energy of the exhaust stream, not the carbon dioxide itself.

The only significant difference between energy drinks and other common soft drinks is the substantially higher caffeine content.

That leaves us with two lines of inquiry: caffeine and general soft drinks. 

There's extensive discussion on the latter and a firm consensus in the medical and nutritional communities that excessive added sugar consumption is the single most problematic aspect of the beverages, as excessive added sugar is associated with a large host of negative outcomes. Alternatively sweetened variants sidestep most of the problems but sane people still recommend moderating intake despite everything being GRAS.

On caffeine, there are certainly very negative repercussions to overdosing, but there are also documented short- and long-term *benefits* to appropriately moderated caffeine consumption, even in tolerant individuals, ranging from athletic performance to neuroprotection.

Genome re-sequencing reveals the history of apple and supports a two-stage model for fruit enlargement

Abstract

&gt; Human selection has reshaped crop genomes. Here we report an apple genome variation map generated through genome sequencing of 117 diverse accessions. A comprehensive model of apple speciation and domestication along the Silk Road is proposed based on evidence from diverse genomic analyses. Cultivated apples likely originate from Malus sieversii in Kazakhstan, followed by intensive introgressions from M. sylvestris. M. sieversii in Xinjiang of China turns out to be an ""ancient"" isolated ecotype not directly contributing to apple domestication. We have identified selective sweeps underlying quantitative trait loci/genes of important fruit quality traits including fruit texture and flavor, and provide evidences supporting a model of apple fruit size evolution comprising two major events with one occurring prior to domestication and the other during domestication. This study outlines the genetic basis of apple domestication and evolution, and provides valuable information for facilitating marker-assisted breeding and apple improvement.",0

I'm inclined to remove the post because the paper is low-quality due to the reasons I'll discuss below, but unfortunately this is actually an article in a peer-reviewed journal. Thus I'll leave this as warning, because in my opinion the paper DOES NOT support the title.

Previous research has shown that THC essentially causes a reduction of ovulation in female animals (including primates). This effect was similarly seen in males (for sperm production), and seemed to be reversible after a few months without exposure. 

The data here is based off of a questionnaire for a larger ongoing fertility study (PRESTO), and the form asked about exposure in the 2 month period prior to enrolling in the study, while the study tracked continued usage. Thus it is important to remember that this is self-reported data. The authors then tried to estimate the amount of time it took each woman to become pregnant and correlate that number with exposure to marijuana. 

The problem is that this study was not set up to be powered to actually examine the effect of marijuana on fertility. This is clear when you see that 245 of 4194 women who became pregnant had exposure before the study. That is simply not enough women with exposure to claim that there is or isn't an effect of marijuana. 

In addition, the authors do not seem to provide controls for the myriad factors that affect a woman's ability to become pregnant. With a small sample size like this, these factors would easily and completely bury any changes related to marijuana specifically in background noise.",1

In the early 90's my wife had an operation about year after our marriage, as they feared ovarian cancer. It turned out the ovary they removed had a benign tumor, but mistakes were made during the surgery. They accidentally stitched her abdominal muscles to the underlying organs in a way that required a second surgery.

It took 3 months to get the second surgery scheduled, and in the intervening time they prescribed her a large allotment of painkillers as she could barely move without pain.

After the second surgery successfully fixed the issue, my wife was fully hooked on painkillers. Unbeknownst to me she started doctor shopping about her pain, and got multiple doctors to prescribe pain pills. Her primary doctors saw the decreasing efficiency of the pain pills prescribed and progressively ordered stronger and strong doses.

&gt; The aim of this study was to investigate Japanese companion animal owners' attribution of emotions to their dogs and cats, as well as how their degree of attachment relates to the attribution of emotions to their animals. The results indicate that respondents attributed a wide range of emotions to their companion animals, with women attributing more emotions than men. Dog owners showed a higher level of attachment to their dogs than cat owners to their cats, while female owners showed a higher level of attachment to their companion animals than did their male equivalents. The degree of attachment was significantly correlated with Japanese respondents' attribution of five of six the primary emotions and all four secondary emotions to their companion animals, with the higher the level of attachment, the stronger the attribution of emotions to animals.

.Army ant-parasitic rove beetles comprise an ancient system of complex convergence
.Beetles anatomically mimic and deceive host ants to exploit nest resources
.Convergent clades arose in the Cenozoic and share a Cretaceous common ancestor
.Convergence over deep time challenges the notion of evolutionary contingency

Summary

&gt; Recent adaptive radiations provide striking examples of convergence [1, 2, 3, 4], but the predictability of evolution over much deeper timescales is controversial, with a scarcity of ancient clades exhibiting repetitive patterns of phenotypic evolution [5, 6]. Army ants are ecologically dominant arthropod predators of the world's tropics, with large nomadic colonies housing diverse communities of socially parasitic myrmecophiles [7]. Remarkable among these are many species of rove beetle (Staphylinidae) that exhibit ant-mimicking ""myrmecoid"" body forms and are behaviorally accepted into their aggressive hosts' societies: emigrating with colonies and inhabiting temporary nest bivouacs, grooming and feeding with workers, but also consuming the brood [8, 9, 10, 11]. Here, we demonstrate that myrmecoid rove beetles are strongly polyphyletic, with this adaptive morphological and behavioral syndrome having evolved at least 12 times during the evolution of a single staphylinid subfamily, Aleocharinae. Each independent myrmecoid clade is restricted to one zoogeographic region and highly host specific on a single army ant genus. Dating estimates reveal that myrmecoid clades are separated by substantial phylogenetic distances-as much as 105 million years. All such groups arose in parallel during the Cenozoic, when army ants diversified into modern genera [12] and rose to ecological dominance [13, 14]. This work uncovers a rare example of an ancient system of complex morphological and behavioral convergence, with replicate beetle lineages following a predictable phenotypic trajectory during their parasitic adaptation to host colonies.

Abstract

&gt; The main objective of this prospective longitudinal study was to investigate bidirectional associations between adolescent cannabis use (CU) and neurocognitive performance in a community sample of 294 young men from ages 13 to 20 years. The results showed that in early adolescence, and prior to initiation to CU, poor short-term and working memory, but high verbal IQ, were associated with earlier age of onset of CU. In turn, age of CU onset and CU frequency across adolescence were associated with (a) specific neurocognitive decline in verbal IQ and executive function tasks tapping trial and error learning and reward processing by early adulthood and (b) lower rates of high-school graduation. The association between CU onset and change in neurocognitive function, however, was found to be accounted for by CU frequency. Whereas the link between CU frequency across adolescence and change in verbal IQ was explained (mediated) by high school graduation, the link between CU frequency and tasks tapping trial and error learning were independent from high school graduation, concurrent cannabis and other substance use, adolescent alcohol use, and externalizing behaviors. Findings support prevention efforts aimed at delaying onset and reducing frequency of CU.",0

"11182",11338,"The physiology that explains this is already known. If you're curious, I'll outline what's happening below with a theoretical example.

The amount of salt/water retained depends on urine osmolality which can range from 50-1200mosms/liter (1200 being the theoretical maximum concentration of urine the kidney can achieve). For simplicity, let's assume that Na is the sole determinant of urine osmolality.

So let's say you drank 1 liter seawater with an osmolality of 1800mosms/L. This means that in order to excrete the salt, you will have to urinate 1.5L (1800/1200 = x/1, x = 1.5). This means that despite drinking 1 liter, you lost 500cc of water and became more dehydrated. This is why you don't drink seawater if you are thirsty --&gt; your urination increases and you loose more fluid than you put in.

In this report, they mention urine salt/water increased with increased salt intake, which makes sense given the physiology outlined above. Then they mention increased water conservation by a urea-driven mechanism. 

What actually is happening is that as you lose salt/water from your body, the volume of blood circulating in your arteries will drop. This triggers baroreceptors in your aorta and carotid arteries, which stimulates the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) then activates channels in the kidney that allow water (and only water - no salt) to be reabsorbed. The key here is that water has to FOLLOW something. Most of it follows sodium, but since we are excreting excess dietary sodium into the urine the kidney has a backup plan - UREA. Urea is recycled and held at a high concentration within the kidney cells (interstitium).  When ADH opens the water channels, the high urea concentration drags water out of the tubule (filtering/excretion system) and into the interstitial cells/vasa recta (reabsorption system). Urea is a product of protein breakdown, and if you are using urea to reabsorb water, naturally you will need more protein intake - this explains the higher food intake seen in this study. 

Now when you reabsorb more water than sodium, the concentration of sodium in the blood decreases. The osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus sense this and decrease the thirst drive (since drinking more water will make the sodium concentration even lower). This is why the study participates drank less. 

Of course these are basic principles that become much more interconnected and complicated in the body but it's generally what's happening. 

EDIT: So after taking a shower, I have a further explanation! Above I describe the physiology of a dehydrated person drinking salt water. In this specific study here's what I think is a more accurate summary for the participants in this study:

Normal person increases salt and water intake. Initially this will cause the kidneys to retain more salt (because the Na reabsorption transporters are hardly ever saturated). Water follows salt. 

Now this causes an increase in effective circulating volume which is sensed both by the afferent arteriole (the artery that delivers blood to the filtering body of the kidney (glomerulus)) and macula densa (sensing how much Na was filtered by the kidney). 

This causes the kidney so say ""OK, we have too much volume here - need to get rid of some."" It does this using hormones that ultimately result in the decreased release of Aldosterone. Aldosterone is the hormone responsible for Na reabsorption, so now without Aldosterone more sodium is lost - along with water. 

There is an important difference between volume (and hypovolemia) and dehydration. You can be dehydrated but have normal volume. In this case, it's possible that by excreting the extra salt and water, you have restored normal volume at the expense of a relative dehydration. To maintain a normal plasma [Na], the hypothalamic osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus will finely tune ADH release and free water reabsorption. (The thirst response is a late survival adaptation that occurs with more severe dehydration. Initially everything is self-regulated as much as possible.) 

So why did study participants drink less? Due to the initial volume expansion sensed by baro- and osmoreceptors - ""Please stop drinking we have too much volume here that we are actively trying to get rid of""

"12027",12201,"The amount of confusion I've seen here is quite frustrating. Several other comments have done a great job of pointing out how this study is misleading, and I won't duplicate that content. Instead, I'll discuss the concerns I've seen with respect to the opioid epidemic, and chronic pain management.

I'll start at the end - the ""opioid epidemic"". Deaths from heroin are up 23% while deaths from fentanyl are up 73%. Meanwhile deaths from prescription opioids are up 4% [source](https://www.statnews.com/2016/12/09/opoid-overdose-deaths-us/). The majority of deaths are coming from street drugs, and the vast majority of new deaths are coming from fake, or tainted drugs. For example, many people know that Prince died from overdosing on opioids. But the fact they were [counterfeit drugs](http://www.businessinsider.com/painkiller-fentanyl-that-killed-prince-was-mislabeled-counterfeit-acetaminophen-hydrocodone-2016-8) gained less attention. 

Legitimate prescription medication still claims it's share of victims, and abuse and over-prescribing absolutely needs to be addressed. New products are emerging to combat that, though. For example, Targin combines Oxycodone, a powerful pain reliever, with naloxone. Naloxone, when administered intravenously or nasally, rapidly reverses the effects of opioids and is a treatment for opioid overdose. However, it has very poor absorption when taken orally. This allows Targin to effectively relieve pain when taken as prescribed, but significantly reduces the ability of the pills to be snorted or dissolved and injected.

Additionally, chronic pain is very real. In some patients, the pain results from diabetic neuropathy, osteoarthritis, and other conditions that are both caused and controlled through lifestyle. While patients and practitioners should make efforts to utilize these venues, it is not reasonable to deny patients analgesia in the meantime. The thought process that patients will rapidly develop tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids is a misnomer, with multiple studies speaking to that - ""Patients who do not have progressive painful disease often achieve a stable dose after titration and require no increase in opioid foses"" (Portenoy, Foley 1986)
""After the opioid is titrated to an acceptable dose, the dose stabilizes if the pain is stable. Further dose escalation in patients with stable pain is unusual"" (Miaskowski, Cleary, Burney, et al., 2005). Tolerance affects the mind-altering affects of opioids, and drug abusers face rapid tolerance when trying to ""get high"" - this does not apply for analgesic use.

Finally, there are limited alternatives to opioids. NSAIDs and acetaminophen have limited therapeutic value and cause thousands of deaths per year as well (and tens of thousands of cases of non lethal illnesses contraindicating their use). ""NSAID induced GI events are blamed for an estimated 100,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths annually in the United States"" (Bombardier, Laine, Reicin, et al, 2000) - that does not even discuss the cardiovascular risks, and yet we hardly hear about the ""NSAID epidemic"". 

I could go on, but, to avoid writing a book - please understand that opioids are a necessary part of acute and chronic pain management, and the answer to the ""opioid epidemic"" comes from many sources (including better care for addicts) - but restricting opioid use too tightly risks causing patients to unnecessarily suffer. There have been[ chronic pain patients commit suicide](https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2016/5/27/are-cdcs-opioid-guidelines-causing-more-suicides) due to lack of access to proper analgesia.

"1541",1562,"Wow, interesting! I've been using plant based keto for resolving migraines.

Edit to add: 

I didn't just suddenly go on a plant based keto diet. 

I had transitioned to plant based (animal product free) over a couple years, trying to figure out why some workout days were so bad compared to a random number where they were really good. 

It turned out I did better the days I was having pb sandwich and veggies for lunch, which seemed contradictory to me, so I started tracking what I was having, and reading and found resources like nutritionfacts.com, and various journal publications/studies, nutrition blogs, etc. 

I stopped eating cow and chicken meats, then pig, then sea/water critter, gave up my diet soda addiction (could have got less from a continuous IV drip was the joke I was often told), gave up sugared food/drinks, dairy, kept feeling better and better; my doc noted when I went in for a blood panel and thyroid check that he felt like he never sees me anymore (I used to have really frequent illness) and noted it had been over a year since I had come in for being sick or for having an infection after a cold. He did a blood panel to check how my thyroid med is doing, and when I went back he lowered my dose, which was great as it is from an autoimmune disease and the dose had always either gone up, or been stable, never down before. The rest of the results were really good too, cholesterol, blood sugars, vitamin levels etc. He asked what changed and I told him. 

So years after all that, and having heard before about keto being used for epilepsy and my neuro having mentioned migraine being found to have some similarity to epilepsy, which was why they were doing epilepsy tests on me (I have had a lifetime of having frequent migraines and was to the point of near constant auras, tried everything over the years offered by clinicians, and most things suggested by family or coworkers and such; only thing that worked was prescription meds for knocking me out, sleeping. until the migraine went away. Not good for a full time worker/parent/spouse).

I was desperate, began researching plant based/vegan keto diets, and found lots of info out there. I got the supplies, recipies, a food processor (omg fat bombs rock), and let my fam know. I went on the diet and the day I noted I was in keto, I had already realized the aura was gone. It stayed gone, and the migraines were gone, too. Finally. I was happy and angry. All the wasted time I had to suffer or sleep through. No one ever suggested trying keto. That was about a year ago.

I currently do keto, mixed with intervals of very low carb high fat somewhat high protein meals (I have concerns about high protein potentially  stressing kidneys), and once in a while if an aura starts coming up, skipping the next meal and then going back to keto eating clears it out.

I could just say vegan keto diet, but my thyroid med has animal products.",0

While some nurses have unionized to get better (safer) hours, no unions (in the US at least) exist for doctors and residents. Residents especially have no control over their hours because they rely on rankings from supervisors and accumulation of as many hours of training (which economically is labor more than education) in order to get into the specialty programs they want.

Additionally, most hospitals end up treating patients for preventable problems that were never addressed or for non-emergencies in the ER due to a dearth of insurance in this country. All these problems come together to force a situation where hospital doctors are under enormous stress and patients don't get the time and attention that would be ideal.

Areas with more available money to spend on schooling, and with voters willing to pay more, are going to be generally wealthier neighborhoods which are already more likely to have all these positives.  


In contrast are examples of many third-world communities with higher graduation rates than American inner-city schools despite their spending being a fraction of the American schools.  More school spending *likely* does mean a better outcome for students, but being brought up in a community that values education more absolutely does.

Children of persons registered for the public plan are also covered by that plan, that is, the one administered by the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec.

2) Private plan : 
Private plans are usually available in the form of group insurance or employee benefit plans. Persons may be eligible for a private plan through employment, through membership in a professional order or association, or through their spouse or parents. Persons who are eligible for a private plan are required to join that plan. (group insurance or employee benefit plans)

Only those persons who are not eligible for a private plan may register for the Public Prescription Drug Insurance Plan. The Plan was set up in 1997 to cover all Quebecers who are not eligible for a private plan.

If you are eligible for a private plan, you must join that plan and provide coverage for your spouse. Two persons (of the opposite sex or the same sex) are considered spouses if they are: (1) married and have entered into a civil union (2) have been living together for 12 months (separations of less than 90 days do not interrupt the 12-month period) (3) are living together (regardless of for how long) and together have had or have adopted a child.

However, in Québec, all private insurers Insurer offering prescription drug insurance must fulfill minimum conditions regarding the coverage they provide and the financial participation they require of the persons they insure.

&gt; **Abstract:** Currently, only presumptive diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can be made in living patients. We present a modality that may be instrumental to the definitive diagnosis of CTE in living patients based on brain autopsy confirmation of [F-18]FDDNP-PET findings in an American football player with CTE. [F-18]FDDNP-PET imaging was performed 52 mo before the subject's death. Relative distribution volume parametric images and binding values were determined for cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Upon death, the brain was examined to identify the topographic distribution of neurodegenerative changes. Correlation between neuropathology and [F-18]FDDNP-PET binding patterns was performed using Spearman rank-order correlation. Mood, behavioral, motor, and cognitive changes were consistent with chronic traumatic myeloencephalopathy with a 22-yr lifetime risk exposure to American football. There were tau, amyloid, and TDP-43 neuropathological substrates in the brain with a differential topographically selective distribution. [F-18]FDDNP-PET binding levels correlated with brain tau deposition (rs = 0.59, P = .02), with highest relative distribution volumes in the parasagittal and paraventricular regions of the brain and the brain stem. No correlation with amyloid or TDP-43 deposition was observed. [F-18]FDDNP-PET signals may be consistent with neuropathological patterns of tau deposition in CTE, involving areas that receive the maximal shearing, angular-rotational acceleration-deceleration forces in American football players, consistent with distinctive and differential topographic vulnerability and selectivity of CTE beyond brain cortices, also involving midbrain and limbic areas. Future studies are warranted to determine whether differential and selective [F-18]FDDNP-PET may be useful in establishing a diagnosis of CTE in at-risk patients.",0

"10392",10538,"Speaking at a surface level, the problem with this headline and the article is that it assumes the field of available interests and passions is nearly infinite and one need only make a choice, have a growth mindset, and maintain some perseverance to develop a passion. 

In some sense, they are saying, 'If you pick something, and put enough effort into it, that thing will eventually become your passion'.  I've seen this before with the ideas of Cal Newport. While I don't totally discount the idea that working more in a particular subject enhances that subject to levels that can be considered passionate, I detest this sort of 'blank slate' thinking because I think the evidence suggests it's just flat-out wrong.

The idea that you can pick almost anything and become passionate about it is absurd for anyone with a degree of introspection and knowledge of psychological metrics. We know that metrics such as IQ, (for which genetics account for at least 60&amp;#37; of the variance, and maybe as high as 80&amp;#37;), absolutely limit the field of potential and available 'passions' one can pursue.  You can't progress or develop a growth mindset in your chosen 'passion' of physics if your IQ is 85, PERIOD.  Add into this the 'Big 5' metrics of personality which also appear to have a strong genetic component (upwards of 40&amp;#37;), and an environmental component that is largely determined by the age of 5; and the field of 'passions' become more limited still.

Food for thought on this point: twin studies have suggested that even career choices have some parameters which may be genetically influenced. While anecdotal, there have been cases of twins separated at birth actually making almost identical career choices; with similar temperaments, pursing identical hobbies, making similar incomes etc. 

Once you add in the environmental forces that, beyond individual differences, carry you along in the ebb and flow of life, you severely limit your options as well. A cursory glance into the autobiographies of histories great scientists and artists tell the story of 'passions' that were pursued based on the available understanding of the world at the time, the level of wealth the family had, chance opportunities, and pressing questions within their respective fields of work.    

I would also go on a limb to argue that cultural rewards also influence what 'passions' come to the surface.  I remember a time before 'big data' salaries. Now, in the past 6 years, there are so many people popping out of the woodwork 'passionate' about data science and coding, I can't believe it.  I wonder what would happen if you decrease those salaries to $50k a year...    

This is not to mention personal decisions that accumulate since birth - at age 25 you already have knowledge and capacity in some fields more than others, which further limit your solution space when trying to develop a given 'passion'.  The authors argue that this is wrong because it hampers a 'growth mindset' and decreases available options.  I argue that this is inevitable and it is damn near impossible to start as a 'blank slate' 25 years into a life, rewrite your psychometric traits, disregard the cultural influences and move forward;  growth mindset or not.

When all is said and done, we are left with a limited 'bag' of interests from which to choose.  I think better advice is: through deep personal introspection, find that 'bag' of interests; find those 3-4 things you absolutely are WAY more interested in than anything else; measure the pros and cons of each in terms of stability, income etc.  and then pull the trigger with a 'growth mindset'.

I am enormously skeptical of this interpretation for a few reasons. I'm not opposed to big finds upending previous understandings, in fact, those kinds of finds are what makes studying human evolution so much fun (H. naledi, Laetoli Site S footprints, H. floresiensis, etc). 

Their dating methodology seems sound (I'm no dating expert), as is the interpretation that the bones have green breaks. 

However, I have huge issues with 1) the ""hammer/anvils"" being the only ""tools"" found and 2) the few percussion marks found. Taphonomy and geochronology is a tricky thing, and natural processes do some weird stuff post-mortem. There's lots of processes that can cause bone modifications that look remarkably similar to hominin butchering activity.  Its the same reason many researchers are supremely skeptical about the Dikika ""cut-marked"" bone. I'm also not convinced that the deposits are not conflated. I work at Laetoli, and you can see stuff from younger deposits that have eroded away, now within older deposits. 

Also, at 130ka, you would expect to see more advanced tools than simple hammer-anvil stuff. Even H. erectus had big ol' Acheulean hand-axes. If this were a ~3.0ma site in Africa, I wouldn't really blink at the interpretation of the association of the mastodon bones with simple tools. But the fact that there's no other tool/tool trash/tool use evidence is highly suspect to me.


also, this is to say nothing of the enormous gap in time periods. Humans almost certainly arrived in the New World earlier than 15ka, and yes its not impossible to imagine this early of a human arrival in the western hemisphere, but this is hardly extraordinary evidence.

&gt; Adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines in aging rodents and primates. Aging humans are thought to exhibit waning neurogenesis and exercise-induced angiogenesis, with a resulting volumetric decrease in the neurogenic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region, although concurrent changes in these parameters are not well studied. Here we assessed whole autopsy hippocampi from healthy human individuals ranging from 14 to 79 years of age. We found similar numbers of intermediate neural progenitors and thousands of immature neurons in the DG, comparable numbers of glia and mature granule neurons, and equivalent DG volume across ages. Nevertheless, older individuals have less angiogenesis and neuroplasticity and a smaller quiescent progenitor pool in anterior-mid DG, with no changes in posterior DG. Thus, healthy older subjects without cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disease, or treatment display preserved neurogenesis. It is possible that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis sustains human-specific cognitive function throughout life and that declines may be linked to compromised cognitive-emotional resilience.

Abstract: For millennia, adults have told children stories not only to entertain but also to impart important moral lessons to promote prosocial behaviors. Many such stories contain anthropomorphized animals because it is believed that children learn from anthropomorphic stories as effectively, if not better than, from stories with human characters, and thus are more inclined to act according to the moral lessons of the stories. Here we experimentally tested this belief by reading preschoolers a sharing story with either human characters or anthropomorphized animal characters. Reading the human story significantly increased preschoolers' altruistic giving but reading the anthropomorphic story or a control story decreased it. Thus, contrary to the common belief, realistic stories, not anthropomorphic ones, are better for promoting young children's prosocial behavior.

Title: **Intragroup Lethal Aggression in West African Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus): Inferred Killing of a Former Alpha Male at Fongoli, Senegal**

For convenience, here is the abstract:

&gt;Lethal coalitionary aggression is of significant interest to primatologists and anthropologists given its pervasiveness in human, but not nonhuman, animal societies. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) provide the largest sample of recorded lethal coalitionary aggression in nonhuman primates, and most long-term chimpanzee study sites have recorded coalitionary killing of conspecifics. We report an inferred lethal attack by resident males on a former alpha male chimpanzee (P. t. verus) at Fongoli in Senegal. We describe the male's presence in the community, his overthrow, social peripheralization for &gt;5 yr, and his attempt to rejoin the group as well as circumstances surrounding his death. We report attacks by multiple chimpanzees on his dead body, most frequently by a young adult male and an older female. The latter also cannibalized the body. Coalitionary killing is rare among West African chimpanzees compared to the East African chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii). This pattern may relate to differences in population densities, research effort, and subspecies differences in biology and behavior.",0

**This study, in no way, is a study meant to be indicative of STEM classes/fields.  The study was done on 1 Physiology class.  The class (of 244) was MAJORITY FEMALE (64%).**

""*While we do not know exactly what is causing a difference in academic self-concept between these groups of students, we can* **speculate** *based in part on our findings for what students use to estimate whether someone is smart. Students used the interactions in class as a proxy for determining whether another student was smarter than them.*""

**Limitations**

*This study was done in one physiology classroom at one institution with a specific student population. Future studies should explore the influence of student characteristics on academic self-concept in other settings. Additionally, students self-reported their participation with regard to their groupmate; the actual level of participation could be different than what the student perceives. Furthermore, reporting on how smart one feels compared with another person may cause students to answer the question in a socially desirable way, although 32.7% of the students admitted to perceiving themselves as smarter than their partner, and 71.3% perceived they were smarter than at least 50% of students in the whole class.*

**Conclusions**

*In exploring student academic self-concept, we found that men and native English speakers had significantly higher academic self-concept relative to the whole class compared with women and nonnative English speakers, respectively. We also found that men had significantly higher academic self-concept relative to their groupmate compared with women. Students identified aspects of active learning that impacted their perception of academic self-concept. Finally, we found that students were more likely to report participating less than their groupmate, if they had a lower academic self-concept.*

"17130",17382,"I have some issues with this study.

&gt; Since the study focused on the first two months of the tax, Zhong said it is too early to tell whether the tax will have lasting impacts on reducing soda and energy drink consumption. Still, there is some evidence from elsewhere that indicates it might.

This could simply be sticker shock at the increased prices for soda. Cook County in Illinois passed a similar measure and the residents practically revolted. The board decided to hastily toss out the tax because they tried to do two things:

1. Say that the tax would lower overall sugary beverage drinking
2. While also saying it was implemented to raise like $200 million in revenue

These are not compatible, at least now how they envisioned it. Buying of soda went down, yes, but it failed to raise the revenue they were predicting, all while the residents were ready to toss out the entire board.

Coca-Cola themselves have [reported](http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/beverage-tax-slows-philly-cokes-retail-sales-by-32) that their sales are down in Philly. But overall sugary beverage sales are not down, which I think is probably because this gets deferred to being called a 'soda tax' more often than not.

I don't see in the study whether they break down whether people were stopping buying soda all together, or whether they just weren't buying it locally anymore. It's like with states that have high gas taxes. If you live on the border of NC, there's basically zero reason you would ever want to buy gas in the state unless you couldn't help it.

Sure, not every resident in Philly is going to transit out to the burbs to stock up on soda, but this is absolutely happening with some people. And with soda being a major money-maker in convenience stores and grocery stores, I'd be interested to see how their bottom line is being impacted.

Costco up in Seattle or Portland (can't remember which), had a soda tax go into effect recently, which absolutely skyrocketed the price of bulk soda. They started printing signage that said something akin to ""REGULAR COSTCO PRICE: $9, PRICE WITH SODA TAX: $17.""

Overall though, this study is WAY too ""recent"" from it being implemented. A longer term study will yield more accurate results. If I casually went to go buy eggs at my store nearby and saw the price had jumped 30%, I too would hold off buying eggs until I saw what was going on.",0

"17373",17629,"There was very little actual data related to the study in the article, but I would like to know how they controlled for other factors besides gun ownership. A quick glance at country rankings by suicide show Sweden just above the US, and Japan and South Korea quite a few rankings above the US. These countries all have incredibly strict gun laws, with virtually no civilian access to firearms, and yet on a per capita basis they have more suicides. This doesn't prove that gun ownership rates have no impact on suicide, but it does show that there are clearly a lot more factors to suicide rates than gun ownership. People don't seem to grasp that while they are the same country, rural Georgia or Alabama have almost nothing in common with New York or LA. There are a lot of other factors at play, and I'm guessing gun access would only account for a very small percentage of the difference in suicide rates, if any.

Development of corticostriatal connectivity constrains goal-directed behavior during adolescence

Abstract

&gt; When pursuing high-value goals, mature individuals typically titrate cognitive performance according to environmental demands. However, it remains unclear whether adolescents similarly integrate value-based goals to selectively enhance goal-directed behavior. We used a value-contingent cognitive control task during fMRI to assess how stakes-the value of a prospective outcome-modulate flexible goal-directed behavior and underlying neurocognitive processes. Here we demonstrate that while adults enhance performance during high stakes, adolescents perform similarly during low and high stakes conditions. The developmental emergence of value-contingent performance is mediated by connectivity between the striatum and prefrontal cortex; this connectivity selectively increases during high stakes and with age. These findings suggest that adolescents may not benefit from high stakes to the same degree adults do-a behavioral profile that may be constrained by ongoing maturation of corticostriatal connectivity. We propose that late development of corticostriatal connectivity sets the stage for optimal goal-directed behavior.",0

I guess Zika just clears normally in a WT mouse model so they remove interferon to allow for infection. But that's got to introduce bias and potential artifacts into the system.

"21505",22355,"Recently, I've been watching some psychology lectures by Dr. Jordan Peterson at U of T.

I'm not a social scientist so I may butcher this, but one of his theories is that human beings (and most other animals) naturally form a hierarchy based on their ability to solve problems and access resources, and that this hierarchy is represented in dedicated brain structures that track how often the organism succeeds or fails at its chosen tasks. Depression, according to him, describes a state in which an organism experiences so many failures that it feels overwhelmed by problems and displays a markedly reduced willingness to take even small risks, which in evolutionary terms is a helpful behavior because if you are the lowest status human who is the worst at getting by in the world, then making even one mistake could kill you, so you'd better avoid risk at all costs.

The article talks about a game in which participants are given a sum of money and asked to choose how to distribute it among themselves and others. In this game, giving a lot of money to yourself and none to others is a risky behavior because they could see that you are being unfair and get angry with you. So, if you're failing a lot in life and getting depressed, it makes sense to be as fair as you can to avoid incurring the wrath of others.

I take it that along the X axis, it's showing the rate of EpiPen administration for schools that DO and DO NOT have that policy in place.

If that's right, then as the article notes the peanut free table policy reduces the incidence of EpiPen usage almost three fold. Peanut free classrooms reduces it by half.

Allowing peanuts to be brought from home or served by the school either doesn't or only slightly increases the use of EpiPens.

If that's right, I'm having trouble parsing ""As shown, restrictive peanut policies don't reduce anaphylaxis.

&gt;But **after passing through the cloud, the photons creep along 100,000 times slower than normal**. Also, instead of exiting the cloud randomly, the photons come through in pairs or triplets. These pairs and triplets also give off a different energy signature, a phase shift, that tells the researchers the photons are **interacting**.

Now, photons interacting and 'slowing down' *within* a medium is relatively normal. Them doing so *after* exiting the medium is completely insane. It would allow such weirdness as creation of light pulses that do not obey the diffraction limit (e.g. high power laser pulses that can be collimated over  large distances from small diameter emitters).

Can someone who has access to the paper itself confirm if this is just the normal press release ignorance, or if this really is the creation of stable photon 'molecules' outside of a controlled medium?",0

Yes, we did. However, due to the nature of science and the culture behind it even the most benign and ""common sense"" things must undergo rigorous and thorough study before it is accepted by the scientific community and government bodies. This same process is part of the reason why smoking took so long to be declared hazardous to your health in a legal and scientific way.

Before all of the surveys, there were plenty of people who decided that smoking was just something ""adults"" did and there was no negative to it.

I'd be interested to see to what degree the change in the birds is genetic vs. epigenetic.  If they were able to reproduce with each other initially, it suggests they're genetically similar enough to do so, which, unless the children are sterile (like mules), which they aren't, this suggest the variation in size &amp; song might be epigenetic &amp; developmental.   

Also, there must have been sufficient pre-existing variation, with a high degree of recombination, otherwise it seems such inter-breeding would result in deleterious mutations.  It'll be interesting to see if this species survives &amp; continues to thrive, given the extreme genetic bottleneck it entailed.

"15311",15534,"Abstract:

&gt;The human body is a template for many state-of-the-art prosthetic devices and sensors. Perceptions of touch and pain are fundamental components of our daily lives that convey valuable information about our environment while also providing an element of protection from damage to our bodies. Advances in prosthesis designs and control mechanisms can aid an amputee's ability to regain lost function but often lack meaningful tactile feedback or perception.

&gt;Through transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with an amputee, we discovered and quantified stimulation parameters to elicit innocuous (nonpainful) and noxious (painful) tactile perceptions in the phantom hand. Electroencephalography (EEG) activity in somatosensory regions confirms phantom hand activation during stimulation.

&gt;We invented a multilayered electronic dermis (e-dermis) with properties based on the behavior of mechanoreceptors and nociceptors to provide neuromorphic tactile information to an amputee. Our biologically inspired e-dermis enables a prosthesis and its user to perceive a continuous spectrum from innocuous to noxious touch through a neuromorphic interface that produces receptor-like spiking neural activity.

&gt;In a pain detection task (PDT), we show the ability of the prosthesis and amputee to differentiate nonpainful or painful tactile stimuli using sensory feedback and a pain reflex feedback control system.

&gt;In this work, an amputee can use perceptions of touch and pain to discriminate object curvature, including sharpness. This work demonstrates possibilities for creating a more natural sensation spanning a range of tactile stimuli for prosthetic hands.

In defense of the industry, supply chain management is a constant moving (expensive) target no one has gotten right. To really do reporting correctly the EPA way you need to know: what wells go to what sites (years after all this stuff came online) to determine oil vs. gas, what equipment is at those sites (which can constantly change so someone in the field with just a GED needs to give enough of a hoot to pass on site changes to environmental), when upset events happen when there's little monitoring equipment and the operator on the beat may not get to the site every day, etc.

However, merely measuring methane levels ""around"" some of the equipment seems like a vast extrapolation for a very complicated energy system that covers thousands of miles. I didn't get much out of the article but it doesn't seem very accurate.

Edit: Managed to get to the actual article on mobile. Looks like it's based on aerial infrared monitoring of 8,000 production sites. It would be interesting to find out if the operators were known because upstream is a bit reminiscent of the wild west. Different operators operate at very different levels when it comes to maintenance. If you don't get a wide pool it could skew the results. Per the article the majority of the emissions stem from non-routine events (aka in a fair number of situations bad maintenance such as leaving a dump valve open).",0

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;If an industrial civilization had existed on Earth many millions of years prior to our own era, what traces would it have left and would they be detectable today? We summarize the likely geological fingerprint of the Anthropocene, and demonstrate that while clear, it will not differ greatly in many respects from other known events in the geological record. We then propose tests that could plausibly distinguish an industrial cause from an otherwise naturally occurring climate event. ",0

Conclusion: tldr - study was small but seemed clear that healthier eating made for faster recovery from depression. 

I think someone in r/science recently complained ""how many times are we going to see studies that show diet is important, and continue to do nothing about it?"" I think they Get to do that again today. 


Edit: I made this comment to help people discuss the source info. I agree that 'healthy' diet is poorly defined. 

Edit: for the sake of sharing from u/switchingtoubuntu

Hijacking:

 1. (Results below significance threshold).

 2. (False Premise) The prescribed diet wasn't largely healthier than any other arbitrary diet, and used an outdated dietary checklist.

 3. (Poor population design) There were sizeable differences between the populations in each the control and dietary therapy groups (medication profiles, sex, etc).

 4. (Conflict of interest) Many of the doctors involved in the study had received money from food companies directly involved in supplying the food specific to the study.

 5. (Poor control) Some patients stopped or altered their meds in the social group but not in the dietary group.

This study is borderline without value due to the above concerns.

If there's any interest at all, it might be due to the perception of their diet being healthier making the patients feel like they are making strides to improve themselves which improved their morale and therefore their depression prognosis, but due to the multitude of other issues, we can be pretty sure there's no actual valuable information to be extracted from this study.

The reason  WHY we make a drug out of this plant is because then you know exactly what the amount of  working compound is in the drug, and that the amount of compound is consistent in every medicine.

The amount of compound can vary from plant to plant. This can lead to either an underdose or an overdose. Think of all the side effects that could have occured to these patients. The fact that it worked in rodents doesnt matter. Rodents are NOT humans and do NOT give a clue of the amount of side effects or efficitivity of a drug in humans. That's why we have phase  1,2,3 trials

Great that it worked for those 18 patients but there could be 100 reasons why the medicine did not work.

-was the medicine stored properly? Does it need to be cooled as a lot medicine must? This is often a major problem in third world countries

**EDIT:**

Better title could perhaps have been ""stomach acidity reducing schemes promote liver disease"" - since it focuses on the impact of reducing the stomach acidity (less effective in killing off organisms) - with resultant impact/burden on liver.

This is primarily related to the general study of microbiome or balance of organisms in stomach/intestines and elsewhere in body which may affect general health.

The authors of the study are linking the abnormal reduction of acidity of stomach - to secondary effects which may lead to changes in that microbiome/balance (and the effect that has on the liver).


**EDIT 2:**

**EDIT 3:**

Summarizing some of the comments.

Some drugs may reduce acidity directly (neutralizing acidity), while others may affect production of gastric acid (proton-pump inhibitors).

Proton-pump inhibitors:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor

&gt;Medically used proton pump inhibitors:
&gt;
&gt;Omeprazole (OTC in the USA)
&gt;
&gt;Lansoprazole
&gt;
&gt;Dexlansoprazole
&gt;
&gt;Esomeprazole
&gt;
&gt;Pantoprazole
&gt;
&gt;Rabeprazole
&gt;
&gt;Ilaprazole (not FDA approved as of May 2017)


Some other well-known drugs:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranitidine

&gt;Ranitidine, sold under the trade name Zantac among others, is a medication that decreases stomach acid production.

Seems it will have the same behavior of affecting stomach acidity levels.


Talcid (Hydrotalcite), Rennie, Gaviscon:

&gt; talcid

- https://www.paulsmarteurope.com/talcid-kautabletten-chewable-tablets-500-mg-100-tbl/

&gt;Active ingredient: Hydrotalcite

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrotalcite

This seems to raise the pH of the water (when used for wastewater treatment) - so probably has same impact i.e. reducing acidity in stomach.

&gt;Rennie

- https://www.rennie.ie/faq/

&gt;Rennie is an antacid which gets to work in the stomach, neutralising excess stomach acid to help remove the discomfort of heartburn &amp; indigestion.

&gt;Gaviscon

- http://www.medications.com/gaviscon

&gt;Gaviscon is based on a mixture of the buffering agents and neutralizers calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, the laxative magnesium carbonate and the gelling agents alginic acid and aluminium hydroxide. When taken by mouth the combination of the alginic acid and bicarbonate creates a barrier which prevents stomach acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus.
&gt;
&gt;If reflux occurs, this protective barrier is the first to contact the esophageal mucosa, in lieu of gastric contents.

So Gaviscon may also reduce acidity of stomach acid - however, it seems to at least claim it ""creates a barrier"", so maybe it can do more without reducing acidity of stomach acid too much (don't know).

**EDIT 4:**

Some non-medicinal ways often mentioned to relieve acid reflux:

- raising the head end of the bed slightly using bricks/wood planks

- eating last meal of the day well before bedtime

Tough adhesives for diverse wet surfaces.

Abstract:

&gt; Adhesion to wet and dynamic surfaces, including biological tissues, is important in many fields but has proven to be extremely challenging. Existing adhesives are cytotoxic, adhere weakly to tissues, or cannot be used in wet environments. We report a bioinspired design for adhesives consisting of two layers: an adhesive surface and a dissipative matrix. The former adheres to the substrate by electrostatic interactions, covalent bonds, and physical interpenetration. The latter amplifies energy dissipation through hysteresis. The two layers synergistically lead to higher adhesion energies on wet surfaces as compared with those of existing adhesives. Adhesion occurs within minutes, independent of blood exposure and compatible with in vivo dynamic movements. This family of adhesives may be useful in many areas of application, including tissue adhesives, wound dressings, and tissue repair.",0

They base salary on qualifications and company budget. If a man takes a job and works for 5 years he earns 5 years of the determined salary for that position, if a women takes that job and works for 5 years she earns that same 5 years salary. However, if the woman has a child and *chooses* to take 8 months out of that 5 years *without pay*, she will have earned 5 years - 8 months of salary. If the man chose to adopt a new born and take 8 months without pay, he would earn 5 years - 8 months of salary.

The only difference is, statistically, women take more maternal leave than men. So they are always going to fall below men when it comes to assessing the average salary per job for each gender.

(1) Editorialization and error-filled writing. This paper very much needs further review. (2) No comparison with conventional CdS QDs.

"17597",17859,"I want to establish some science here.  **\(edit: please read my point \(d\) first... had i done a full critical read first I would have made the point about their torturing data and p\-hacking my primary point\).**

**a\) The very low suicidal thinking incidence of both groups of women \(0.2\-0.8\% after week\) is \(EDIT\): lower \(but within range\) than the rates we would expect for any human being undergoing any medical issue.**  That being said, one\-item surveys aren't always the best screens.  I am literally a suicidologist and this number is not elevated nor surprising.  It's ... low\-ish?  But what can you do \- this was not a comprehensive risk assessment.

b\) In general, it is accepted that women receiving an abortion are at a two\-fold risk for dying by suicide compared to **nonpregnant women**.  [http://journals.sagepub.com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/doi/abs/10.1177/1403494814560844](http://journals.sagepub.com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/doi/abs/10.1177/1403494814560844)

However, this is **grossly misinterpreted by ideologues** as saying that ""abortion causes a 2 fold increase in suicide.""  **There are many different risk factors of suicide** in the pool of ""women receiving an induced abortion"" and ""all nonpregnant women"".  Different rates of abuse, mental illness, physical illnesses, partner situations, exposures to violence, access to quality health care, circumstance, economics, age, etc.

c\) There are many comments that are being made about the lack of a control group that are completely unfounded.  They selected a very specific population for a very specific scientific reason.

**By selecting women who were seeking abortion near the gestational limit**, they controlled for a number of variables that would otherwise be confounders.  Literally, this study was extremely clever to already select for women who were considering abortion where they could be split into the two groups of having received it or not.  This is MORE controlled for the question of ""**does abortion cause suicide""** than following women at the identification of their pregnancies, because more social, internal, and environmental ideas are at play.

d\) ***THIS STUDY GROUP NEEDS TO STOP TORTURING THEIR DATA.***

The group that constructed this survey is continuing to publish multiple reports off of the same data set, significantly reducing the statistical significance of their reporting.

"11863",12034,"Approximately 66 million years ago, a massive asteroid or comet smashed into the Earth near what we now think of as the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico. On the other side of the world, in India, at a place called the Deccan Traps, a period of intense volcanic eruption began - one that would last tens of thousands of years.

These catastrophic and powerful events are often considered the primary causes of the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period that wiped out most of the dinosaurs along with 75% of life on the globe.

But brand-new research reveals another factor that may have played a role in ending the era of the most massive creatures to ever walk the surface of the planet. It seems dinosaur eggs took a particularly long time to hatch. That means that when they had to compete for sparse resources in a post-extinction event world with the more efficient amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals that made it through that era into the next one, dinosaurs may have lost out.

Compared to reptiles, birds lay few eggs, and they are particularly large. This could hamper their competitiveness, since it exposes them to destructive risks. But bird eggs hatch about twice as fast as reptiles (their behavior keeps eggs warm and stable), which researchers think helps enough survive to hatch. Dinosaurs still exist in the form of birds - avian dinosaurs - and so researchers thought that the eggs of the non-avian varieties would still hatch at about the same fast rate as bird eggs do. After all, from what we can tell, non-avian dinosaur and bird eggs have similar structures and birds are the only remaining dinosaurs for us to base these hypotheses on.

But the new study, published January 2 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reports that dinosaur eggs took far longer to hatch. For one species studied, researchers estimate that a comparable bird egg would take between 40 and 82 days to hatch. The dinosaur egg, it seems, would have incubated between 83 and 171 days before it was ready, more like a reptile.

And that changes a lot of what we know about dinosaurs.

Protoceratops AntoninJury/Wikimedia Commons
It's all about the teeth

The amount of time it takes for young to be born has a significant impact on how a species lives. It can define mating season, migratory behavior, and other characteristics.

Dinosaurs had large eggs and, in general, adults expended more energy than comparably sized reptiles or amphibians, putting a limit on their competitiveness.

By studying the growth of embryonic teeth in other species, researchers have been able to determine how long it took for the infants of those species to develop. So the team behind this study, consisting of researchers from Florida State, the University of Calgary, and the American Museum of Natural History, decided to try to calculate embryonic tooth growth in two dinosaur species, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri (a sort of ""duck-billed"" dinosaur) and Protoceratops andrewsi (a less-famous relative of the Triceratops).

The researchers saw that a certain measure that can be used to calculate embryonic tooth development in both human and crocodilian species exists in dinosaur species as well. So they evaluated fossil teeth from the above species.

Their calculations showed that the Protoceratops egg would have taken more than twice as long to incubate as a comparable bird egg, and would have been just a bit quicker to develop than a similar reptile. The Hypacrosaurus egg would have incubated even longer, needing more time than a similar reptile.

As the study authors write, this means that many hypotheses of dinosaur behavior may need to be re-evaluated. It was thought that perhaps these species made long migrations back and forth from the Arctic between seasons, but long egg incubation periods may have made this impossible. And while these new findings are just based on evaluations of fossils from two species of dinosaur, the authors say they think these long incubation periods would most likely be found in all toothed dinosaurs - though further research could always change that conclusion.

The other big effect this may have had is on the extinction of these creatures. We already believe dinosaurs expended more energy and needed more resources than reptiles or amphibians. They took a long time to mature, unlike many mammals and birds. When the resources of the world were devastated by a changed climate after the asteroid struck and during the period of volcanic activity, it became hard for any large species to survive. Slow hatching rates would have been just another blow to the non-avian dinosaurs. And that may help further explain why none made it through that time.

Abstract:

&gt;Despite its recent slowdown, immigration from Latin America continues to be a controversial issue. Some scholars argue that the social climate is increasingly inhospitable to Latinos, potentially fueling discriminatory attitudes and behaviors. However, little research has examined Latinos' experiences with discrimination, especially variation by nativity and legal status. We address this issue with research on perceived discrimination among Mexican and Central American residents of Los Angeles County, a major destination for Latin American immigrants. Using data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey and the American Community Survey, the analyses consider immigrants' legal status, intersectionality, and competing perspectives on assimilation. The results show that undocumented immigrants do not report especially high levels of discrimination. Instead, young U.S.-born Latinos are the most likely to report mistreatment in interpersonal and institutional domains. Neighborhood ethnoracial and income diversity also have implications for perceived exposure to different types of discrimination.

Abstract:
&gt;Users of psychedelic drugs often report that their sense of being a self or 'I' distinct from the rest of the world has diminished or altogether dissolved. Neuroscientific study of such 'ego dissolution' experiences offers a window onto the nature of self-awareness. We argue that ego dissolution is best explained by an account that explains self-awareness as resulting from the integrated functioning of hierarchical predictive models which posit the existence of a stable and unchanging entity to which representations are bound. Combining recent work on the 'integrative self' and the phenomenon of self-binding with predictive processing principles yields an explanation of ego dissolution according to which self-representation is a useful Cartesian fiction: an ultimately false representation of a simple and enduring substance to which attributes are bound which serves to integrate and unify cognitive processing across levels and domains. The self-model is not a mere narrative posit, as some have suggested; it has a more robust and ubiquitous cognitive function than that. But this does not mean, as others have claimed, that the self-model has the right attributes to qualify as a self. It performs some of the right kinds of functions, but it is not the right kind of entity. Ego dissolution experiences reveal that the self-model plays an important binding function in cognitive processing, but the self does not exist. ",0

"1258",1271,"""A negative effective mass can be realized in quantum systems by engineering the dispersion relation. A powerful method is provided by spin-orbit coupling, which is currently at the center of intense research efforts. Here we measure an expanding spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate whose dispersion features a region of negative effective mass. We observe a range of dynamical phenomena, including the breaking of parity and of Galilean covariance, dynamical instabilities, and self-trapping. The experimental findings are reproduced by a single-band Gross-Pitaevskii simulation, demonstrating that the emerging features-shock waves, soliton trains, self-trapping, etc.-originate from a modified dispersion. Our work also sheds new light on related phenomena in optical lattices, where the underlying periodic structure often complicates their interpretation.""

However, if you just look at the mothers, older mothers are more likely to be overweight. I'd be very interested to see if they controlled for mother's age independent of the obesity factor. Another element to consider, people who carry fat around their middle (as oppsed to fat thighs) have a higher probability for cancer. It has been theorized that this higher cancer rate is caused by lipid solvant organic pollutants accumulating in the body fat, and that fat being in close proximity to the organs in the middle. The same argument could be applied to austism or other birth defects related to obesity in pregnancy --ie. not the fat itself but instead the mutagen chemicals that are readily available in close proximity to the fetus.
